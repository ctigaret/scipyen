""" Various utilities for dealing with neo data structures for electrophysiology.

NOTATIONS USED BELOW:

"cursor": signalviewer.SignalCursor object

"cursor time point", "cursor time coordinate", "cursor domain coordinate": 
the value of a cursor's 'x' attribute (floating point scalar). This is the 
undimensioned value of the signal's domain at the cursor position.

The module provides a set of utility functions to operate primarily on objects
in NeuralEnsemble's neo package (http://neuralensemble.org/), 
documented here: https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Some of these function also apply to datatypes.DataSignal in Scipyen package.


I. Cursor- and epoch-based functions
=====================================

These functions measure a signal parameter on closed intervals that are defined
using, respectively, signalviewer.SignalCursor objects or a neo.Epoch.

The type of SignalCursor objects must be:

SignalCursor.SignalCursorTypes.vertical, 
or 
SignalCursor.SignalCursorTypes.horizontal.

The difference between cursor- and epoch-based functions consist in the way the 
functions calculate the signal values at the interval boundaries, and in the
number of intervals that a single function can process.

1 Cursor-based functions: named with the prefix "cursor_" or "cursors_".

The function uses the 'x' and 'xwindow' attributes of a vertical or crosshar 
SignalCursor. These are floating point scalars and are converted internally to
python Quantity scalars with the units of the signal domain.

'x' is the horizontal coordinate of the cursor.
'xwindow' is a duration of a horizontal window (or interval) centered on 'x'

1.a "cursor_*" functions use a single cursor:
    * the signal interval is defined by the cursor's horizontal window 
        (the 'xwindow' attribute).
     
    * the signal values at the interval boundaries, if used, are the actual 
        signal sample values at the interval's boundary time points 
        (the interval is closed, i.e. it contains its boundaries)
        
    List of functions based on a single cursor:
    
    cursor_value: the signal sample value at the time point of the cursor 
        (i.e., at the cursor's 'x' attribute) regardless of the size of the
        cursor's 'xwindow'
        
    cursor_min, cursor_max: returns the signal minimum (maximum) across the 
                cursor's horizontal window (or cursor_value if xwindow is zero)
                
    cursor_maxmin: return a tuple of signal max and min in the cursor's window
    
    cursor_average: average of signal samples across the cursor's window.
        NOTE: When cursor's xwindow is zero, this calls cursor_value()
    
    cursor_argmin, cursor_argmax: the index of the signal minimum (maximum) 
                in the cursor window
        
    cursor_argmaxmin: tuple of indices for signal max and min in the cursor's 
            window
            
    
    If the cursor's horizontal window is zero, the above functions return
    the signal sample value at the cursor's coordinate or index 0
    
    
1.b "cursors_*" functions use two cursors to define a signal interval:
    * the signal interval is bounded by the cursor's 'x' coordinates, and is
        closed (i.e. the boundaries are part of the interval):
        
        left boundary: left_cursor.x
        
        right_boundary: right_cursor.x
        
    * the signal values at the interval boundaries, if used, are the averages
        of signal samples across the cursor's horizontal window, if not zero, at
        the respective boundary.
        
        
    List of functions based on two cursors:
    
    cursors_difference: the signed difference between the signal values at two cursors.
        NOTE: for each cursor, the signal value "at the cursor" is determined by 
        calling cursor_average(). This means that, if the cursor's xwindow is 
        zero, the value "at cursor" is the actual sample value at the cursor's
        time coordinate.
        
    cursors_chord_slope
    
All cursor-based functions return a python Quantity array of shape(m,1) with
    m = number of channels.
        
2. Epoch-based functions: named with the prefix "epoch_".

These functions use a single neo.Epoch object to define signal intervals. 

An interval is described by time and duration, contained in the 'times' and 
'durations' attributes of the neo.Epoch object. Since both these attributes
are numeric arrays with the same length, it follows that a neo.Epoch can define 
more than one interval. All intervals are considered closed (i.e. they contain
their boundaries).

    For interval 'k' where 0 <= k < len(epoch) the boundaries are:
        left boundary: times[k]
        right boundary: times[k] + durations[k]
        
The 'times' and 'durations' are python Quantities in time units ("s" by default)
as are the units of the signal domain.

Signal values at the interval boundaries, if used, are the sample values at the
the boundary time points (unlike "cursors_*" functions).

The "epoch_*" functions return a python Quantity array with the shape (m,n) with

    m = number of intervals in the epoch
    n = number of channels in the signal
    
List of neo.Epoch-based functions:
    epoch_average
    

As a rule of thumb:

* when several scalar measures, each derived from a signal interval, are needed,
use neo.Epoch to define the signal intervals where the measures are calculated.

* when a single measure derived from two signal locations is needed, use 
signalviewer.SignalCursors to define the locations.

IX Generic indexing for the neo framework (provisional)
========================================================
    Structured indices:
    
    child_collection_name is obtained by calling neo_child_container_name(...)
    
        it can be a 
        
        data_child_collection_name (sequence of data objects), 
        
        or a
        
        container_child_collection_name (sequence of container objects)
        
        In both cases these are prescribed attribute names of 
        neo.container.Container objects.
    
    indices = an iterable of int (i.e., tuple, list or range), NOT a slice
    
    root container: a top level neo container object (neo.container.Container)
    
    subcontainer: a neo container object that is contained in another neo container.
    
    containment of neo objects can be:
    
    a) direct containment: the neo object is an element of a sequence of neo 
        objects of the same type, and this sequence is a member (attribute) of 
        a neo.container.Container object. 
        
        For example, a neo.AnalogSignal object is an element of "analogsignals", 
        which is a member of a neo.Segment object: the Segment object contains 
        the AnalogSignal object "directly"; the AnalogSignal object is contained
        "directly" by the Segment object.
        
        The Segment object is the "root" container; the search for the neo 
        object starts with the root.
        
    b) indirect containment: a neo object is contained in a neo container which
        itself is directly contained by a root neo container.
        
        For example:
        
        A neo.AnalogSignal object is directly contained by a neo.Segment object,
        and the Segment object is directly contained by a neo.Block object.
        
        Therefore the AnalogSignal object is contained indirectly by the Block.
        
        The Block object is the "root" (top level) container, and the Segment 
        object is a sub container. 
        
        There can be more than one level of indirect containment (see the 
        composition hierarchy schematics below).
    
    Below, child_collection_name is specific for the type of neo object that
    if looked up _for_
    
    
    NOTATION:
    ========
    container: a neo.Container
    
    contained type: a type that is an element of a member collection
    
    member: an attribute of a type instance (gettable by calling getattr)
    
    member collection  = sequence (list or tuple) of objects, that is
    a member of a neo.Container
    
    COMPOSITION HIERARCHIES for neo 0.8.0
    =====================================
    Data object containers are specialized on the types of data object they
    may contain. The neo library allows for a data object type to be
    simultaneously contained in different types of container objects.
    
    The top-level container in neo library is a Block. However, data
    objects are never direcly contained in a block. Instead, a Block
    instance is composed of iterable collections of container objects. In 
    turn, each container object in the collection is composed of collections
    of data objects.
    
    In short, objects in the neo library are never directly contained. Instead,
    tey are stored in appropriate collection of objects with the same type.
    
    For example, neo.AnalogSignal objects are contained in a list which can
    be a member of a neo.Container instance, either a Segment, or a
    ChannelIndex (or both).
    
    Therefore, analog signals have two types of parents: Segment and 
    ChannelIndex, and both of these are in turn contained in collection members
    of a Block instance. The composition hierarchy looks like a diamond:

                        \                /                                    
                Block.segments        Block.channel_indexes                                    
                           \           /                                    
                            \         /                                    
                               Block                                    
        
    
    Likewise, neo.SpikeTrain objects can only be found in th member list of
    of a Segment (Segment.spiketrains) or a Unit. Unit is a Container which 
    is only contained in a ChannelIndex (although it can be also accessed in
    read-only mode from a Block). The composition hierarchy looks like this:
        
                      SpikeTrain    
                    /            \ 
                   /              \ 
                  /                \ 
                 /                  \
                /                    \
        Segment.spiketrains         Unit.spiketrains
                \                     |            \
                 \                    |             \   
                  \            ChannelIndex.units    \
                   \                 /                \
                    \               /                 |
              Block.segments  Block.channel_indexes   |
                      \           /                   |
                       \         /                    |
                          Block  - - - - - Block.list_units
                          
        
    For all other BaseSignal types there a direct (linear) composition 
    hierarchy:
        
              ImageSequence, Epoch, Event
                            |
                            |
                            |
             Segment member colection name: 
             imagesequences, epochs, events
                            |
                            |
                            |
                          Block
        
    And also for other neo object types:
        
                     RegionOfInterest
                            |
                            |
                            |
                  Block.regionsofinterest
                            |
                            |
                            |
                          Block
        
        
    As a design decision, when the container is a Block and we lookup a
    neo.AnalogSignal, we traverse the container's Segments.
    When the container if another container (which for a signal can 
    only be a ChannelIndex) when then get directly to its analogsignals
    member collection.

    for analog signals, should indicate preference between "segments" and "channel_indexes"
        default is "segments"
    
    for spike trains, should indicate preference between "segments" and "units"
        default is "segments"
        if "units", this implies traversing "channel_indexes" if looking up in
        a Block
    

    Example 6: nested index of signal in a sequence of blocks
    =========================================================
    {index1:    {"segments": {index1: {child_collection_name: indices},
                              index2: {...},

    Parameters
    
    ----------
    
    in1 : neo.AnalogSignal, neo.IrregularlySampledSignal, datatypes.DataSignal, or np.ndarray.
    
        Must be a 1D signal i.e. with shape (N,) or (N,1) where N is the number 
        of samples in "in1"
    
        The signal for which the correlation with "in2" is to be calculated. 
        
        Typically this is the longer of the signals to correlate.
        
    in2 : neo.AnalogSignal, neo.IrregularlySampledSignal, datatypes.DataSignal, or np.ndarray
    
        Must be a 1D signal, i.e. with shape (M,) or (M,1) where M is the number 
        of samples in "in2"
        
        The signal that "in1" is correlated with (typically, shorter than "in1")
        
    Var-keyword parameters
    
    -----------------------
    
    method : str {"auto", "direct", "fft"}, optional; default is "auto"

    name : str
        The name attribute of the result
        
    units : None or a Python Quantity or UnitQuantity. Default is None.
    
        These is mandatory when "a" is a numpy array
    
        The units of the returned signal; when None, the units of the returned 
        signal are pq.dimensionless (where "pq" is an alias for Python quantities

def cursors2epoch(*args, **kwargs) -> typing.Union[neo.Epoch, typing.Sequence]:
    """Constructs a neo.Epoch from a sequence of SignalCursor objects.
    
    Each cursor contributes to an interval in the Epoch.
    
    SignalCursor objects are defined in the signalviewer module; this function
    expects vertical and crosshair cursors (i.e., with cursorType one of
    SignalCursor.SignalCursorTypes.vertical, 
    SignalCursor.SignalCursorTypes.horizontal). 
    
    SignalCursors can be represented by tuples of cursor 
    "parameters" (see below), although tuples and cursor objects cannot be mixed.
    
    Variadic parameters:
    --------------------
    *args: One or more SignalCursor object(s) (comma-separated list) or a  
        sequence (tuple, list) of SignalCursor objects.
        
        SignalCursor objects must all be of type vertical or crosshair.
        
        Alternatively, the function accepts tuples (2, 3 or 5 elements) of
        cursor parameters, instead of actual SignalCursor objects, as follows:
        
        a) 2-tuples are interpreted as (time, window) pairs of coordinates
            for a notional vertical cursor
            
        b) 3-tuples are interpreted as (time, window, label) triples of 
            parameters of a notional vertical cursor
            
        c) 5-tuples are interpreted as (x, xwindow, y, ywindow, label) tuples of
            a notional crosshair cursor. In this case only the x, xwindow and
            label elements are used.
            
        NOTE 1: the cases (a) and (b) are the value of the 'parameters' property
        of a vertical and crosshair cursor, respectively. This means that such
        a tuple can be obtained by referencing cursor.parameters property.
        
        NOTE 2: Mixing SignalCursor objects with parameter tuples is NOT allowed.
        
    Var-keyword parameters:
    ----------------------
    
    units: python Quantity or None (default)
        By default, the epoch's units are seconds (pq.s) but in a neo.Epoch can
        support any units
    
    name: str, default is" Epoch"; not used when intervals is True (see below)
    
    sort: bool, default if True
        When True, the cursors are sorted by their x coordinate
        
    intervals: bool, default is False.
    
        When True, the function returns triplets of (start, stop, label)
        
        Otherwise returns a neo.Epoch
        
    Returns:
    -------
    
    When intervals is False (default), returns a neo.Epoch with intervals 
        generated from the cursor x coordinates and horizontal windows:
        
            times = cursor.x - cursor.xwindow/2
            durations = cursor.xwindow
            
            By design, the epoch's units are time units (pq.s by default)
            
    When intervals is True, returns a list of triplets:
            (start, stop, label)
            
            If units are provided, start and stop are python Quantity scalars,
            otherwise they are floating point scalars.
            
    Examples:
    ========
    
    Given "cursors" a list of vertical SignalCursors, and "params" the 
    corresponding list of cursor parameters:
    
    >>> params = [c.params for c in cursors]
    
    >>> params
        [(0.20573370205046024, 0.001, 'v2'),
         (0.1773754848365214,  0.001, 'v1'),
         (0.16775228528220001, 0.001, 'v0')]
         
    The following examples are valid call syntax:

    >>> epoch = cursors2epoch(cursors)
    >>> epoch1 = cursors2epoch(*cursors)
    >>> epoch2 = neoutils.cursors2epoch(params)
    >>> epoch3 = neoutils.cursors2epoch(*params)
    
    >>> epoch == epoch1
    array([ True,  True,  True])

    >>> epoch == epoch2
    array([ True,  True,  True])
    
    >>> epoch2 == epoch3
    array([ True,  True,  True])
    
    >>> epoch4 = neoutils.cursors2epoch(*params, units=pq.um)
    >>> epoch4 == epoch3
    array([False, False, False]) #  because units are different
    
    >>> interval = cursors2epoch(cursors, intervals=True)
    >>> interval1 = cursors2epoch(*cursors, intervals=True)
    
    >>> interval == interval1
    True
    
    >>> interval2 = neoutils.cursors2epoch(params, intervals=True)
    >>> interval3 = neoutils.cursors2epoch(*params, intervals=True)

    """Returns a time slice from a neo.Block or neo.Segment object.
    
    The time slice is a Block or a Segment (depending on the type of "data"
    object) with the time slice of all signals or from selected signals.
    
    NOTE: neo.AnalogSignals.time_slice() member function fulfills the same role.
    
    Positional parameters:
    ---------------------
    
        data: a neo.Block or a neo.Segment
        
        t0: a neo.Epoch, a scalar or a python quantity in time units
        
            When 't0' is an EPoch, it already specifies both the start time and 
            the duration of the time slice.
            
            When 't0' is a scalar real or a python quantity, it only specifies 
            the start time; then, either 't1' (end time) or 'window' must be 
            also given (see below).
        
        
    Keyword parameters:
    -------------------
        t1: (optional, default = None) scalar, a python quantity in time units, 
            or None;
            
            NOTE that when 't0' is an epoch, 't1' is calculated from 't0' and 
            the value given for 't1' here is discarded:
            
                t1 = t0.times + t0.durations
                
                t0 = t0.times
            
        window (optional, default = 0): scalar, or python quantity in time units.
        
            NOTE: window is MANDATORY when 't1' is None and 't0' is NOT an epoch
            (see NOTE below)
            
        segment_index (optional, default = None): scalar index or sequence of indices
            for the segments in the data, from which the time slice is to be extracted.
            
            Only used when data is a neo.Block.
            
            When None, the result will contain the time slices taken from all segments.
            
        analogsignal_index (optional, default = None): index or sequence of indices
            for the AnalogSignals (regularly sampled) in each segment. 
            When None, the function will return time slices from all signals found.
            
            The index can be specified as an integer, or as a string containing
            the signal name.
            
        irregularsignal_index (optional, default = None): 
            as for analogsignal_index, this is an index or sequence of indices
            for the IrregularlySampledSignals in each segment. When None, the 
            function will return time slices from all signals found.
            
            The index can be specified as an integer, or as a string containing
            the signal name.
            
        spiketrain_index (optional, default is None): index of sequence of indices
            of spiketrains; same semantics as for analogsignal_index
            
        epoch_index (optional, default is None): index of sequence of indices
            of epochs; same semantics as for analogsignal_index
            
        event_index (optional, default is None): index of sequence of indices
            of event ARRAYS; same semantics as for analogsignal_index
            
            NOTE: each segment may contain several neo.Event arrays; this index
            specifies the Event ARRAY, not the index of individual events WITHIN
            an Event array! Similar to the other cases above, neo.Event arrays
            can also be selected by their "name" attribute (which is the name of 
            the entire Event array, and NOT the name of individual events in the
            array).
        
    NOTE: 
        When 't0' is a scalar, the time slice is specified as 't0', 't1', or as
        't0', 'window'.
        
        In the latter case, the window gives the duration CENTERED AROUND t0 and 
            the time slice is calculated as:
            
            t1 = t0 + window/2
            
            t0 = t0 - window/2.
    
    NOTE: 2019-11-25 20:38:44
    
    From neo version 0.8.0 segments also support time_slicing

    Returns:
    --------
    
    A new Block containing AnalogSignal data that are averages of the AnalogSignal 
    object in the *args across the segments, taken n segments at a time, every m segments.
    
    Depending on the values of 'n' and 'm', the result may contain several segments,
    each containing AnalogSignals averaged from the data.
    
    NOTE:
    
    By contrast to average_blocks_by_segments, this function can result in the 
    average of ALL segments in a block (or sequence of blocks) in  particular
    when "count" and "every" are not set (see below).
    
    The function only takes AnalogSignal data, and discards IrregularlySampledSignal
    SpikeTrain, Event and Epoch data that may be present in the blocks specified
    by *args.
    
    This is because, by definition, only AnalogSignal data may be enforced to be 
    shape-compatible for averaging, and this is what usually one is after, when 
    averaging multiple electrophysiology record sweeps acquired with the same
    protocol (sampling, duration, etc).
    
    For this reason only analog_index can be specified, to select from the
    analogsignals list in the segments.
    
    Examples of usage:
    ------------------
    
    >>> blocklist = getvars(sel=neo.Block, sort=True, by_name=False, sortkey="rec_datetime")
    >>> # or:
    >>> blocklist = getvars(locals(), sel="[\W]*common_data_name*", sort=True, by_name=True)

            a time slice within the signal, used for the detection of the events.
            
            This is recommended in case the trigger signal contains other 
            waveforms in addition to the trigger waveform.
            In this case, the trigger waveform will be searched/analysed within
            the signal regions between these two time points (right-open interval).
            
        When empty, no events of the corresponding type will be constructed.

    A TriggerEvent is an array of time values and will be added to the events list
    of the neo.Segment objects in src.
    
    Calls detect_trigger_events()
    
    Parameters:
    ===========
    
    src: a neo.Block, a neo.Segment, or a list of neo.Segment objects
    
    analog_index:   specified which signal to use for event detection; can be one of:
    
                    int (index of the signal array in the data analogsignals)
                        assumes that _ALL_ segments in "src" have the desired analogsignal
                        at the same position in the analogsignals array
    
                    str (name of the analogsignal to use for detection) -- must
                        resolve to a valid nalogsignal index in _ALL_ segments in 
                        "src"
                    
                    a sequence of int (index of the signal), one per segment in src 

    event_type: a str that specifies the type of trigger event e.g.:
                'acquisition',
                'frame'
                'imaging',
                'imaging_frame',
                'imaging_line',
                'line'

                'user'
                
            or a valid datatypes.TriggerEventType enum type, e.g. TriggerEventType.presynaptic
    
    (see detect_trigger_events(), datatypes.TriggerEventType)
    
    Named parameters:
    =================
    times: either None, or a python quantity array with time units
    
        When "times" is None (the default) the function calls detect_trigger_events() 
        on the analogsignal specified by analog_index in src, to detect trigger 
        events. The specified analogsignal must therefore contain trigger waveforms 
        (typically, rectangular pulses).
        
        Otherwise, the values in the "times" array will be used to define the 
        trigger events.
        
    label: common prefix for the individual trigger event label in the event array
            (see also detect_trigger_events())
    
    name: name for the trigger event array 
            (see also detect_trigger_events())
    
    use_lo_hi: boolean, (default is True);  
        when True, use the rising transition to detect the event time 
            (see also detect_trigger_events())
        
    time_slice: pq.Quantity tuple (t_start, t_stop) or None.
        When detecting events (see below) the time_slice can specify which part of  
        a signal can be used for automatic event detection.
        
        When time_slice is None this indicates that the events are to be detected 
        from the entire signal.
        
        The elements need to be Python Quantity objects compatible with the domain
        of the signal. For AnalogSignal, this is time (usually, pq.s)
        
    NOTE: The following parameters are passed directly to embed_trigger_event
    
    clearSimilarEvents: boolean, default is True: 
        When True, existing neo.Event objects with saame time stamps, labels,
            units and name as those of the parameter "event" will be removed. 
            In case of TriggerEvent objects the comparison also considers the 
            event type.
            
        NOTE: 2019-03-16 12:06:14
        When "event" is a TriggerEvent, this will clear ONLY the pre-exising
        TriggerEvent objects of the same type as "event" 
        (see datatypes.TriggerEventType for details)
        
    clearTriggerEvents: boolean, default is True
        when True, clear ALL existing TriggerEvent objects
        
        NOTE: 2019-03-16 12:06:07
        to clear ONLY existing TriggerEvent objects with the same type
            as the "event" (when "event" is also a TriggerEvent) 
            set clearSimilarEvents to True; see NOTE: 2019-03-16 12:06:14
    
    clearAllEvents: boolean, default is False:
        When True, clear ANY existing event in the segment.

    spike_value: scalar, default is 5000 (mV)

    atol, rtol: scalar floats: absolute  and relative tolerance, respectively, 
        for locating spike times in a linear time array (default for both: 1e-12)
        
        See np.isclose() for details
        
    skipInvalidTimes: bool (default True)
    
        If True, then invalid times (that fall outside the half-open interval 
        [start..start+duration) ) are skipped.
        
        When False, the function raises an error whenever an invalid time is found
        (see above).
        
    maxSweepDuration: scalar float (in s) or None (default is None)
        if given as a scalar float and the duration exceeds the sweep length
        then a list of analogsignals (one per sweep) will be produced having 
        a duration specified here
        
        
    asNeoSignal: bool (default, False) 
        When False, (the default) the function returns the spike trace as a 1D array
        (column vector).
        
        When True, the function returns the spike trace as a neo.AnalogSignal 
        object, in combination with the next named parameters
        
    NOTE: the following parameters are passed to the neo.AnalogSignal constructor
    and are used only when asNeoSignal is True:
        
    time_units: python Quantity (time, default is pq.s)
    
    spike_units: python Quantity (default is pq.mV)
    
    name: None, or str (default is "Spike trace")
    
    description: None or str (default is "Synthetic spike trace")

def parse_trigger_protocols(src):
    """Constructs a list of TriggerProtocol objects by parsing TriggerEvent objects in "src".
    
    Parameters:
    ==========
    "src" can be a neo.Block with a non-empty segments list, or 
        a list of neo.Segments, or just a neo.Segment
        
    Returns:
    =======
    A list of protocols
    src
        
    ATTENTION: this constructs TriggerProtocol objects with default names.
    Usually this is NOT what you want !!!
    
    Individual TriggerEvent objects can be manually appended to the events 
        list of each neo.Segment.
    
    Alternatively, the function detect_trigger_times() in "neoutils" module can 
    help generate TriggerEvent objects from particular neo.AnalogSignal arrays
    containing recorded trigger-like data (with transitions between a low and 
    a high state, e.g. rectangular pulses, or step functions).
    
    Returns an empty list if no trigger events were found.
    
    NOTE: each segment in "src" can have at most ONE protocol
    
    NOTE: each protocol can have at most one event for each event type in 
        presynaptic, postsynaptic, and photostimulation
    
    NOTE: each event object CAN contain more than one time stamp  (i.e. a 
        pq.Quantity array -- which in fact derives from np.ndarray)
    
    NOTE: several segments CAN have the same protocol!
    
    Once generated, the TriggerProtocol objects should be stored somewhere, for 
    example in the "annotations" dictoinary of the block or segment so that they
    won't have to be recreated (especially when their names/event time stamps
    will have been customized at later stages)
    
    CAUTION: The TriggerEvent objects in the protocols are COPIES of those found
        in "src". This means that any permissible modification brought to the 
        events in the TriggerProtocol is NOT reflected in the events of the source
        "src".
        
        To enable this, call embed_trigger_protocol() by using:
            each protocol in the result list
            "src" as target
            clearTriggers parameter set to True
    
        NOTE: Permissible modifications to TriggerEvents are changes to their 
            labels, names, and units. These will be reflected in the embedded
            events whenn they are stored by reference.
        
            Event time stamps can only be changed by creating an new TriggerEvent.
            To reflect time stamp changes in the "src" events, call remove_events()
            then embed_trigger_event() for the particular event and neo.Segment 
            in "src".

    ----------
    signal: one of neo.AnalogSignal, neo.IrregularlySampledSignal, 
            datatypes.DataSignal, or datatypes.IrregularlySampledDataSignal.
        
    value: float scalar, the nominal value of the domain, or a monotonic 
            sequence (tuple, list) of scalars.
            
            When a scalar, the function looks up the signal samples that correspond 
            to domain values close to value within the atol and rtol, 
            using numpy.isclose().
            
            NOTE 1:
            
            `a` and `b` are "close to" each other when
            
            absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))
            
            When a sequence, its elements are boundaries of bins to which domain
            values belong (half-open intervals, direction specified by the 
            value of `right`); the function looks up signal samples for the 
            domain values with indices that fall these bins, as determined using 
            numpy.digitize().
            
            NOTE 2: From numpy.digitize docstring:
            
            numpy.digitize(x, bins, right=False)[source]

                False     decreasing      bins[i-1] >  x >= bins[i]   x in [bins[i], bins[i-1])
                True      decreasing      bins[i-1] >= x >  bins[i]   x in (bins[i], bins[i-1]]

            If values in x are beyond the bounds of bins, 0 or len(bins) is 
            returned as appropriate.        
            
    channel: int, default 0: the index of the signal channel; must be 
        0 <= channel < signal.shape[1]
        
    rtol, atol: float scalars defaults are, respectively, 1e-05 and 1e-08 as
        per numpy.isclose(); used when value is a scalar
        
    equal_nan: bool, default False; specifies if np.nan values are treated as
        equal; used when value is a scalar
        
    right: bool, default False; see documentation for numpy.digitize() for details
        used when value is a sequence
        
    Returns:
    -------
    ret: Array with signal values where signal samples in the specified channel
        channel are
        
            "close to" the specified nominal value (see the NOTE 1, above).
        
            OR 
            
            fall within the boundaries of specified in value
        
    index: Indexing array used to extract ret from the domain
    
    domain_vals: Subarray of the signal, indexed using the "index" array.
    
    CAUTION:
    For regularly sampled signals (e.g. neo.AnalogSignal or datatypes.DataSignal)
    this function will almost surely fail to return all signal values where the 
    domain is close to the specified nominal value. The success depends on the 
    sampling rate and signal quantization error.
    
    A better strategy is to search for the INTERSECTION between domain sample 
    indices where domain <= upper limit and those where domain >= lower limit.

    signal: one of neo.AnalogSignal, neo.IrregularlySampledSignal, 
            datatypes.DataSignal, or datatypes.IrregularlySampledDataSignal.
        
    value: float scalar, the nominal value of the signal, or a monotonic
            sequence (tuple, list) of scalars.
            
            When a scalar, the function looks up the domain values corresponding 
            to signal samples that are close to value within the atol and rtol, 
            using numpy.isclose().
            
            NOTE 1:
            
            `a` and `b` are "close to" each other when
            
            absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))
            
            When a sequence, its elements are boundaries of bins to which signal
            values belong (half-open intervals, direction specified by the 
            value of `right`); the function looks up the domain values for the 
            signal samples with indices fall in these bins, as determined using 
            numpy.digitize().
            
            NOTE 2: From numpy.digitize docstring:
            
            numpy.digitize(x, bins, right=False)[source]
                
                Return the indices of the bins to which each value in input array belongs.
                right     order of bins   returned index i satisfies  meaning
                False     increasing      bins[i-1] <= x <  bins[i]   x in [bins[i-1], bins[i])
                True      increasing      bins[i-1] <  x <= bins[i]   x in (bins[i-1], bins[i]]
                False     decreasing      bins[i-1] >  x >= bins[i]   x in [bins[i], bins[i-1])
                True      decreasing      bins[i-1] >= x >  bins[i]   x in (bins[i], bins[i-1]]

            If values in x are beyond the bounds of bins, 0 or len(bins) is 
            returned as appropriate.        

    channel: int, default 0: the index of the signal channel; must be 
        0 <= channel < signal.shape[1]
        
    rtol, atol: float scalars defaults are, respectively, 1e-05 and 1e-08 as
        per numpy.isclose(); used when value is a scalar
        
    equal_nan: bool, default False; specifies if np.nan values are treated as
        equal; used when value is a scalar
        
    right: bool, default False; see documentation for numpy.digitize() for details
        used when value is a sequence
        
    Returns:
    -------
    ret: Array with domain values where signal samples in the specified channel
        channel are
        
            "close to" the specified nominal value (see the NOTE 1, above).
        
            OR 
            
            fall within the boundaries of specified in value
        
    index: Indexing array used to extract ret from the domain
    
    sigvals: Subarray of the signal, indexed using the "index" array.
    
    CAUTION:
    For regularly sampled signals (e.g. neo.AnalogSignal or datatypes.DataSignal)
    this function will almost surely fail to return all domain values where the 
    signal is close to the specified nominal value. The success depends on the 
    sampling rate and signal quantization error.
    
    A better strategy is to search for the INTERSECTION between domain indices where
    signal is <= upper value limit and indices where signal >= lower value limit.
    
    WARNING: Do not confuse with the functionality of pynverse module.
    
    Considering the signal as being the realization of a function y = f(x) where
    x is the signal's domain and y the signal values, one might be inclined to 
    use the pynverse module by Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez to calculate its inverse
    function x = g(y) numerically. 
    
    However, pynverse uses functional programming to calculate the inverse of a 
    mathematical function represented as a python function, or callable, and 
    not an array realization of that function (see pynverse documentation for 
    details).
