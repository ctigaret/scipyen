PREAMBLE: This is for Windows 10
=========
I. LOCATION OF SOURCE CODE, BUILDS & INSTALLED LIBRARIES

We follow the following convention:

1) all source code and built software resides in a ROOT directory on a LOCAL
drive (i.e. NOT mapped network drive or anything else)

On this machine, the ROOT is E:\

It goes without saying that you need read/write acess to that. Failing that,
you MAY choose the ROOT to be a directory where you have read/write access.

2) The path to the root and to all things inside it MUST NOT CONTAIN SPACES OR
SPECIAL CHARACTERS (e.g accented characters, etc).

3) The ROOT itself has the following subdirectories:
    ROOT\src        - contains the source trees, including cloned git repositories
    ROOT\bin        - installations will place built *.exe and *.dll here
    ROOT\lib        - installations will place built *.lib files here
    ROOT\include    - installations will place header files (e.g., *.h, *.hxx, *.hpp) here
    ROOT\share      - installations will place other auxiliary files here
    ROOT\downloads  - contains downloaded installers for ancillary software (see
                      below) and archives of source trees NOT available from
                      git/gitlab (e.g., boost_1_77_0.7z, etc.)

    You will have to create the "src" and "downloads" directorie manually;
    the others ("bin", "lib", "include", "share") will be created during the
    installation after building.

    AFTER BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE FIRST LIBRARY BELOW (zlib) edit the
    environment variables for your account to:

    add ROOT\bin to PATH
    create INCLUDE=e:\include
    create LIB=e:\lib

    The "downloads" directory contains software installers for required software
    as well as zip archives for source code trees that cannot be obtained from
    online repositories (git, gitlab).

    NOTE: This layout makes it very easy for CMake-based building of software
    from source trees (as most of the ones below are)

4) All source code trees for various libraries reside in their own subdirectories
in ROOT\src

II. DRIVE SPACE REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------
All source code trees and built dependencies will require about 20-30 GiB (tbc).
so the drive containing the ROOT directory should have well in excess of that.

Visual Studio and Code, Python and user-installed python packages via pip,
usually reside on the C: drive (the pip-installed packages reside inside the
Users\Your Account\AppData\Programs\PythonXY\Library\site-packages).
Visual Studio also needs extra temporary drive space during building.
To be comfortable, there should be a free space in excess of 20 GiB on your
C: drive.

Please take this into account if you decide to place ROOT on the C: drive.

III. Compiler & toolset
-----------------------
The C compiler identification is MSVC 19.29.30133.0
The CXX compiler identification is MSVC 19.29.30133.0
Windows-10.0.19043

For every library built in Visual Studio you need to make an x64-Release
configuration
    Build configurations: x64 release,
        For CMake-based projects (as mot of them are) the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE will
        read "RelWithDebInfo"
    toolset msvc_x64_x64 (as reported by VisualStudio)

Configure to install each library in in ROOT (see I.3 above).

    For CMake-based projects build with Visual Studio 2019 the installation
    directory MUST be configured using the Advanced settings section of the
    IDE's CMake settings - DO NOT change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

    Generally is it a BAD idea to make direct changes to CMake settings in
    VisuaStudio - the only exception if building VigRA but we will use cmake-gui
    to generate a solution (*.sln) file.

IV. Prerequisites (ancillary software):
--------------------------------------
Visual Studio community editon 2019 and visual studio code;
git, gh and github desktop
7zip
cmake - no need
doxygen

make sure no other CMake is on your path other than what is provided by
Visual Studio 2019 (later we will use a standalone CMake-gui exe to build vigra,
but that need not be on your PATH)

NOTE: to use gh you should have an account with github (eaziest way and costs
nothing) otherwise clone with VisualStudio ofr github desktop

================================================================================


1. build zlib
=====================

from https://zlib.net/ download zlib source code, version 1.2.11,
zipfile format (730K,
SHA-256 hash d7510a8ee1918b7d0cad197a089c0a2cd4d6df05fee22389f67f115e738b178d)

extract to src => src\zlib-1.2.11

NOTE: this is a CMake project

open the \src\zlib-1.2.11 directory as "Folder" in VisualStudio 2019
    create x64-Release configuration, build type: RelWithDebInfo
    save and refresh CMake cache
    go to advanced settings:
        select Install directory: the ROOT (see above) where "bin", "include",
            "lib" and "share" subdirectories will be created.

    save configuration
    build: Build menu -> Build All
    install: Build menu -> Install zlib
    close project
    close Visual Studio

Modify environment variables (in Windows Settings, search "environment", select
"Modify Environment variables for your account"):
Add ROOT\bin to PATH
Create INCLUDE=ROOT\include
Create LIB=ROOT\lib

(See PREAMBLE for what the ROOT is; on this machine, ROOT is E:)

2. build libpng
=======================
download lpng1637.zip

from https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng16/1.6.37/lpng1637.zip/download?use_mirror=jztkft

extract to src => src\lpng1637

to build: launch visual studio 2019 -> "open project or solution" -> choose:
    src\lpng1637\projects\vstudio\vstudio.sln

accept all projects

accept migration to VS 14.2 (VS community edition 2019) -> adaps all *.vcxproj files in
the subdirectories

open configuration manager,
    in active solution platform (currently, win32) choose <new> ->
        choose new platform: x64, check ON create new project platforms

    in Active solution configurations select Release

    in the Build check ONLY libpng (we will use the zlib built as above)

    copy src\lpng1637\scripts\pnglibconf.h.prebuilt to src\lpng1637\pnglibconf.h

    open properties for libpng (sub)project -> right click -> properties
        -> Configuration properties:

                -> Include directories -> add ROOT\include
                -> External include directories -> add ROOT\include
                -> Libray directories -> add ROOT\lib;ROOT\bin
            -> C/C++:
                -> General:
                    -> Additional include directories -> add ROOT\src\lpng1637;ROOT\include
                    -> Treat warning as errors -> No (/WX-)

            -> Linker:
                -> General:
                    -> Additional librarr directories -> add ROOT\lib

    Build menu -> build solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
    the built files are in
    src\lpng1637\projects\vstudio\x64\Release
    from there:
        copy libpng16.dll, libpng16.pdb to ROOT\bin
        copy libpng16.lib, libpng16.exp to ROOT\lib

    also copy all include files (*.h) from src\lpng1637 to ROOT\include

3. build jpeg9d (optional, see jpeg-turbo, below)

4. build jpeg-turbo => jpeg AND jpeg-turbo
==========================================
gh repo clone winlibs/libjpeg
open "folder" in VisualStudio 2019 -> CMake project
configuration x64-Release:
    build type RelWithDebInfo
    toolset msvc_x64_x64
    CMake generator: Ninja
    CMake variables:
        CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

        WITH_TURBOJPEG (true)

5. build libtiff
================
from https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff clone (blue button) -> open in Visual Studio Code (HTTPS)
    -> choose location directory ROOT\src

    => will create a clone of libtiff repository in ROOT\src\libtiff

open visual studio -> Open a filder -> select ROOT\src\libtiff

read through the CMake output

create configuration x64-Release (in CMake Setting -> Configurations)

Build menu -> build all
Buils menu -> Install tiff

check that it works: from http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/images.html
download https://download.osgeo.org/libtiff/pics-3.8.0.tar.gz
unpack with 7zip => ROOT\src\libtiffpics

open command prompt, cd ROOT\libtiffpic
tiffcp -lzw cramps.tif x.tif
tiffcmp cramps.tif x.tif
tiff2pdf -o cramps.pdf cramps.tif
tiff2bw jello.tif jello_bw.tif

also you may run tiffinfo on all tif files in this directory

6. build Imath (NOTE this is "eye-math" not "ell-math" !)
==============================================================
get it from https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath

clone git repo:
gh repo clone AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath

open "folder" in VS2019; as above make x64 release configuration, select ROOT
for install directory (here this is e:\).

Build all
Install Imath

7. build openEXR
=================
get it from https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr
cd to ROOT\src and clone git repo :
gh repo clone AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr

open Visual Studio -> open folder -> ROOT\src\openexr
create x64 release
Imath should be recognized
build & install

8. build HDF5
===============
get the CMake version of the source tree :
from https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/
download CMake-hdf5-1.12.1.zip
extract
copy build-VS2019-64-Hermes.bat from downloads to
ROOT\src\CMake-hdf5-1.12.1

Open command prompt, run vs64

cd to ROOT\src\CMake-hdf5-1.12.1 and execute build-VS2019-64-Hermes

don't worry about test 1726 - H5DUMP-tfloatsattrs (Failed) message
(see here https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/h5dump-test-failed/8762/2)
to install, extract the newly created zip file
ROOT\src\CMake-hdf5-1.12.1\build\HDF5-1.12.1-win64.zip and copy the contents of
the subdirectories to their corresponding directories in ROOT
(e.g. from bin\*.* to ROOT\bin, etc)
NOTE: DO NOT copy zconf.h obe the one already present in ROOT\include
(they are identical, and the latter has been provided by zlib, see above)


9. Install fftw3 libraries
=============================

download fftw-3.3.5-dll64.zip from http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

Extract all into ROOT\src\fftw3

As per the above web page create import libraries (from an x64 command prompt):

cd ROOT\src\fftw3

lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3-3.def
lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3f-3.def
lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3l-3.def

then copy:
    *.exe and *.dll files to ROOT\bin
    *.lib, *.def, *.exp files to ROOT\lib
    *.h files (actually fftw3.h) to ROOT\include

10.Install Boost libraries:
===========================

from https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/more/getting_started/windows.html#get-boost
download boost_1_77_0.7z
extract to ROOT\src\ => will create ROOT\src\boost_1_77_0
Create the b2 Boost.Build program
cd boost_1_77_0\tools\build
bootstrap
.\b2 --prefix=ROOT\Boost.Build toolset=msvc install

(e.g., .\b2 --prefix=E:\Boost.Build\bin)

App ROOT\Boost.Build\bin to PATH

Restart the x64 command prompt

go to ROOT\src\boost_1_77_0

run (NOTE: make sure to replace root with the full real path; as per PREAMBLE 2
spaces in the ROOT path should be avoided; where this is impossible, then all
paths below should be enclosed in double-quotes):

b2 toolset=msvc threading=multi address-model=64 variant=release link=shared -prefix=ROOT --build-type=complete msvc stage
b2 toolset=msvc threading=multi address-model=64 variant=release link=shared -prefix=ROOT --build-type=complete msvc install

When prefix is a drive this will install:
    * the headers in ROOT\include\boost_1_77_0\boost
        => add this to the INCLUDE environment variable

    * the *.dll and *.lib files in ROOT\lib
As per Getting Started page, create, build and run:
1) header-only program in VS2019 (see heading 4 Build a simple program using boost)
2)

11. Create python virtual environment
=====================================
e:
virtualenv scipyenv -p python3
modify and copy scipyact.bat to a Scripts directory in your home directory
(i.e., your %USERPROFILE% e.g.c:\Users\your_user_name)
Add the Scripts directory to your PATH (using Windows Settings, as described above)

12 Install python packages
===========================
a) Install in the virtual environment
---------------------------------------
install (using pip):
sphinx, nose, PyQt5 (this will pull sip, PyQt5 and PyQt5-sip), numpy, scipy,
sympy, jupyter, jupyter-qtconsole-colorschemes, matplotlib, jupyterlab,
pyqtgraph, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn, scikit-image, confuse,
python-magic, pyxdg, neo, qimage2ndarray, pywavelets, imreg-dft, nixio, h5py
pingouin, cmasher, cmocean, researchpy

Check that PyQt5 works:
start python then run:
import sys
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets
app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
win = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()
win.show()

close the window then exit()

Check that jupyter qtconsole works:
jupyter qtconsole


Check that matplotlib works in qtconsole:
%matlplotlib
expect to see the message "Using matplotlib backend: Qt5Agg" (wait a while)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure()
exit

Check that matplotlib also works in python
(run the last three lines above; the %matplotlib is a jupyter-specific macro!)
in addition you have to call plt.show() to display the figure , when in plain
python.

b) Install the above outside the virtual environment

13 Build VIGRA
==============

cd to ROOT\src
clone the vigra repo:
git clone https://github.com/ukoethe/vigra.git
    if cloning 1.11.0, replace:
        vigra\src\impex\hdf5impex.cxx
        vigra\vigranumpy\src\core\segmentation.cxx

        with the ones supplied in downloads\vigra_patches

        NOTE: the new hdf5impex.cxx uses a deprecated syntax which does not fit
        the more recent function signature in H5Opublic.h

        NOTE: the new segmentation.cxx adapts an issue in MSVC C++ sort
        algorithm in <algorithm> header (apparently their compiler cannot
        distinguish between iterator and const_iterator from the context -
        unless there is a hidden compiler flag that would make it behave more
        like gnu g++)


Build using VisualStudio2019
---------------------------------------

NOTE: if you use the virtual environment then call VS2019 from the command prompt
AFTER calling scipyact (ie. with the environment activated)

Otherwise you may launch vs2019 as usual.

Open "folder" ROOT\src\vigra

create x64-Release configuration

you may have to:
1) point to the python libray - choose
    ROOT\lib\boost_python39-vc142-mt-x64-1_77.lib

build

install

from src\vigra\out\install\x64-Release\ copy:
    bin\vigraimpex to e:\bin and e\lib
    lib\*.* to e:\lib
    include\*.* to e:\include

(here e:\is considered the root)

ATTENTION: the following is required to get python to properly load the vigra
libraries in windows 10 using Python 3.9:
in your own Scripts directory create a pyton script wih the following contents:

import os
os.add_dll_directory("e:/bin") # <-- replace here where vigraimpex.lib and vigraimpex.dll are
os.add_dll_directory("e:/lib") # <-- replace here where vigraimpex.lib and vigraimpex.dll are

Add the following line to your scipyact.bat script:
SET PYTHONSTARTUP=%USERPROFILE%\Scripts\scipyen_startup.py
