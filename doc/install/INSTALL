Adapted to the situation where:
1) the machine already has Python >= 3.9.7 installed.

2) 3rd party libraries are provided system-wide by the distribution
(boost, Qt5, PyQt5, pytables)

3) source trees for what needs built are now located OUTSIDE the virtual
environment

4) Focussing on Python 3.10 where possible

================================================================================
PREAMBLE
================================================================================
This file describes how to install scipyen and its dependencies in a virtual
environment (python3), independent of the system or local (i.e. "user") python
site packages.

Applies to: GNU/Linux platforms

The advantage of a virtual environment include the possibility of installing and
building software directly in this environment, without the need for administrator
(superuser) privileges, and without interfering with system-wide or account-wide 
software.

This means the software can be uninstalled re-built, etc, without worrying about
the local account or system-wide interference.

Disk space requirements: ~ 5 GiB (including sources and build binary dependencies
in the virtual python environment)

Dependencies
------------
1) Python >= 3.9 either supplied with the distribution, or built from sources 
              (and installed typically in /usr/local)

2) virtualenv

3) Python pip packages listed in the pip requirements file:
    pip_requirements_Linux.txt,   for Linux,
    pip_requirements_Windows.txt, for Windows

    WARNING: if migrating to a more recent Python version, and there are packages 
    installed via pip as --user, then it is highly likely to have executable 
    Python scripts in $HOME/.local/bin

    In particular, the script "virtualenv" in $HOME/.local/bin WILL overshadow any
    "virtualenv" script installed in the system-wide site-packages of your desired
    Python version.

    If that is the case then you may forcefully use the latter by launching it 
    with a specific version of the Python interpreter
    e.g., python3.10 -m virtualenv env_dir
    
    Where env_dir is the fully qualified path of the virtual environment directory
    
    OR temporarily rename the $HOME/.local/virtualenv file to something else
    
4) A python virtual environment running the desired version of Python executable.
    
    NOTE: This is in order to run Scipyen in a software environment insulated
    form the system-wide or user-installed 3rd party libraries and Python packages
    installed via pip.
    
    Be aware that some dependencies do rely on system-wide libraries and software
    (e.g., fftw3, tiff, jpeg, png, doxygen, cmake, and build toolchain).
    
    This means that the software installed in the virtual environment MAY HAVE
    TO BE REBUILT upon upgrading to a new OS distribution.

5) Software libraries to be built from sources, and installed inside the virtual
environment:
    
PyQt5 (including PyQt5.sip, sip5.5 if building PyQt5 from sources)
    NOTE: on Windows, it is suffiient to install re-build PyQt5 via pip, inside
        the virtual environment
    
    While pre-built PyQt5 can also be used on Linux, it has the disadvantage that
    the PyQt5 binaries supplied via pip are oblivious to the system-wide Qt5 
    plugins that are installed on the machine. This is manifest, e.g., in the 
    inconvenience that PyQt5 widgets are unable to use the global appearance of 
    other Qt5 aplications installed on the machine. For this reason, and for
    insulating Scipyen from sysem-wide PyQt5 library upgrades, it is convenient
    to build PyQt5 from sources inside the virtual environment.

vigra 
    NOTE: this needs:
        boost - including boost python, graph, threads
        fftw3, tiff, jpeg, png, optionally, openexr
        python packages - numpy, sphinx, nose - these are listed in the pip 
            requirements mentioned above

NEURON
    Optional, if you want to use Scipyen as a pseudo-IDE for NEURON
    
    Requires libXcomposite, bison, flex, CMake, cython, mpi, ncurses
    
    NOTE: This needs to be built from sources, especially on Linux; on Windows
    I haven't yet tested the feasibility of using pre-build binaries (via pip).
    
6) Build chain toolkit - to build the software above
    On Linux: gnu compiler collection, make, ld, qmake (for PyQt5)
        
    See also the file 'c_cpp_requirements_unix.txt'
    
    On Windows: , VisualStudio community edition (2019 or later)
    
    On both platforms: cmake, doxygen (documentation generator), git software
    (to access source code repositories; optionally, you may use GitHub's gh 
     command line utility, and/or GitDesktop on Windows only)
    
NOTE: On windows, these dependencies can be built OUTSIDE the virtual environment
(see INSTALL for Windows.txt)

Which Python?
-------------
Scipyen should be used with Python >= 3.9

On Linux, this can be the Python stack as distributed with the OS, or one 
built locally from sources. 

Steps:
================================================================================
1. Clone the Scipyen git repo somewhere convenient (e.g. in $HOME)
================================================================================

    REQUIRES:
        git software (system-wide installation) including gitk and git-gui
            NOTE: get this using your OS distribution's software management - it
            is basic enough to be able to install it in this way; otherwise you
            may have to build & install it from sources
            
        Optional:    
        github cli (for Linux, also for Windows; other platforms may use github 
                    desktop app, you mileage mau vary)
(for various distributions see https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)
    
        openSUSE/SUSE Linux (zypper)
            Install:

            sudo zypper addrepo https://cli.github.com/packages/rpm/gh-cli.repo
            sudo zypper ref
            sudo zypper install gh
            
        To use gh you need to authenticate with github (if not already done)
        gh auth login ==> select GitHub.com, then when prompted enter username
            and password (you will have to create a free github account )
            
    Clone scipyen
            gh repo clone ctigaret/scipyen
        
        OR:
        
            git clone https://github.com/ctigaret/scipyen.git
        
        Then cd into scipyen and verify local repo is uptodate with the relevant
        branches:
            
            git checkout master
            git pull
            git checkout work
            git pull
            git checkout dev
            git pull

From now on, ALWAYS make sure you are on the dev branch (this also contains the 
doc/installation directory with pip requirements, etc). You may wish to run at
regular intervals:
    
            git checkout dev
            git pull
            
In the following we assume that scipyen has been cloned in $HOME/scipyen

================================================================================
2. INSTALL THE FOLLOWING PACKAGES AS PER YOUR OS DISTRIBUTION:
================================================================================
These will be installed system-wide hence will be available regardless of 
whether you are in an activate python virtual environment or not.

Unless specified, these MUST be installed together with their corresponding 
'devel' packages.

Where appropriate, a MINIMAL version is specified. If the current distribution 
does NOT provide these, then they should be built. Examples on how to do this are
given further below, for Python 3.9.7, boost 1.77.0

        Software                            Required for/by:
        packages
================================================================================
        Python >=3.9.7                      Running Scipyen
        
        This is necessary to satisfy dependencies of newer version of packages 
        used by Scipyen, such as:
        neo
        
    If not available from your distribution, you may want to build Python from 
    source, and 'make altinstall' (see below, and Python/Unix/README for details)
    
        boost >= 1.77 including:               Build VIGRA
        Boost.Python (py3), 
        Boost.Python.NumPy, 
        Boost.MPI,
        Boost.MPI Python 3 serialization, 
        Boost.Thread, 
        Boost.Atomic, 
        Boost.Chrono, 
        Boost.Graph, 
        Boost.Graph parallel
        
        NOTE: Boost can be built inside the virtual Python environment, see below.
    
    
        Qt5                                 Scipyen GUI

        cmake3, cmake3-full                 Build VIGRA and NEURON

        sqlite3                             Build VIGRA
        libXcomposite  (for NEURON)         Build VIGRA
        valgrind (optional)
--------------------
NOTES:
 you also need to install their corresponding 'devel' packages

================================================================================
3. BUILD PYTHON (OPTIONAL, see above)
================================================================================

NOTE: This is RECOMMENDED if the distribution is behind the latest Python by 
(quite) a few minor versions.

For example, OpenSuSE Leap 15.3 installs Python-3.6.12; here, we use Python 
3.9.7 where there have been some significant changes, and because the latest neo 
package doesn't support python < 3.7

NOTE: 2022-01-20 22:02:56 Scipyen code is now essentially using Python3.9!

NOTE: If you choose to build Python then the following Python packages must also
be built locally (from inside the activated virtual python environment, see below):
    sip
    PyQt5
    PyQt5_sip
    tables
        

To build Python from sources (e.g. 3.9.7) see the file:

    $HOME/scipyen/doc/install/Python/Unix/README
    
ATTENTION: To avoid overshadowing/overwriting your system's python3 executable,
ALWAYS run 'make altinstall' AND NOT 'make install' after 'make'-ing the Python
software.

'make altinstall' needs to be followed by running 'ldconfig' (both as superuser)

From here on we assume Python-3.9.7 was built then installed in /usr/local.

================================================================================
4. CREATE A PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT, INSTALL pip PACKAGES
================================================================================

In short (example using sistem-wide Python 3.9):
    
    user@site:~> python3.9 -m virtualenv scipyenv39
    
    will create scipyenv39 in $HOME directory
    
    NOTE: Avoid paths with unicode characters and networked (e.g. NFS-mounted) 
    partitions
    

4.1 Create Scipyen configuration scripts - $HOME/.scipyenrc

    user@site:~> cd scipyen/doc/install
    user@site:~/scipyen/doc/install> ./make_script_links.sh <path-where-environment-is> <path-to-scipyen-diretory>
    
4.2 activate the environment:
    start a new terminal the call 'scipyact'

From here on we assume the environment directory is $HOME/scipyenv39 (the name
reflects the use of Python-3.9)

4.3 install pip requirements

call pip install -r $HOME/scipyen/doc/install/pip_requirements_Linux.txt

WARNING: The installation of PyQt5 wheel using pip is, by default, disabled in
pip_requirements_Linux.txt (the line is simply commented-out) for the reasons
pointed out in 5.1 below.

HOWEVER, PyQt5 IS REQUIRED to run Jupyter qtconsole and Scipyen's GUI. 

If you decide NOT to build PyQt5 but to rely on the installation of a binary PyQt5
wheel, then enable the installation of PyQt5 in pip_requirements_Linux.txt first,
by "un-commenting" the line (remove the "#" and any spaces at the beginning of 
the line containing PyQt5).

The disadvantage of this is that the PyQt5 elements in Scipyen do not follow, or
integrate with, the Qt GUI settings of your desktop (especially when using KDE).

=================================================================
5. BUILD DEPENDENCIES(*)
=================================================================
(*) If not installed system-wide. NOTE: You may want to build PyQt5 (see 
    4.1, below) as pip only installs a pre-build wheel containing only the 
    default Qt5 widget style (fusion) and no access to the system's widget 
    styles.
    
    
The directory of the virtual environment is referred to as VIRTUAL_ENV - a
shell variable which will be available after activating the environment (see 4.2)


It is recommended to individual subdirectories in VIRTUAL_ENV/src/ directory,
for storing the source trees of the software to be built. 

If there are space contraints, this src directory can be placed on another 
local partition - avoid networked partitions.

NOTE: From here on we assume all source trees are in $VIRTUAL_ENV/src  and
we operate from an activated virtual environment, in the $VIRTUAL_ENV/src directory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 BUILD AND INSTALL sip-5.51, PyQt5-5.15.3, PyQt5_sip-12.8.1 IN THIS ORDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: These can also be installed via pip. However, the binary wheel installed
has its own copy of Qt which comes only with a default style ("Fusion", on Linux)
To use the host platform look and feel of Qt widgets you have to build PyQt5 and 
PyQt5.sip as below.

If you are not bothered by this, then skip to (4.2) below after enabling the
instalaltion of PyQt5 (via pip) in pip_requirements_Linux.txt.

For each of these, cd into their source tree and run:

..............
5.1.1 sip:
..............
    Extract sip-5.5.1.dev2011271026.tar.gz from scipyen-dependencies/Unix
    to $VIRTUAL_ENV/src

    cd into the source directory tree,
    activate the virtual environment, then run:
    
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
    
..............
5.1.2 PyQt5:
..............
    REQUIRES: Qt5 and Qt5-devel packages installed on the host machine.
    
    NOTE: This is building PyQt5 binary libaries from source, using Qt5 
    libraries (and devel packages) available on your local platform (usually,
    system-wide, and independent of the python's virtual environment).
    
    YOU MAY HAVE TO REBUILD the PyQt5 binaries after upgrading your platform's 
    Qt5 stack. This is more likely to happen when your platform is running a 
    "rolling release" OS distribution such as OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. 
    
    If, after such upgrade you see messages about missing symbols or version 
    mismatches related to one of libQt5xxx libraries when launching scipyen from 
    the terminal, then it is very likely you need to rebuild PyQt5.
    
    
    Use downloaded PyQt5-5.15.3.dev2012141313.tar.gz from scipyen-dependencies/Unix
    
    PyQt5-5.15.7.dev2202011035.tar.gz from here:

    extract to $VIRTUAL_ENV/src, cd into the source directory tree,
    activate the virtual environment, then run:
    
    python configure.py --confirm-license --qmake=`which qmake-qt5` --designer-plugindir=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/qt5/plugins/designer --qml-plugindir=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/qt5/plugins/PyQt5 --qsci-api-destdir=$VIRTUAL_ENV/share/qt5 --no-python-dbus --sip=$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/sip5 > config_output 2>&1
    
    NOTE: configuration output will be redirected to the file config_output
    NOTE: if in trouble at this stage, also pass --verbose option to configure.py
    
    make 
    make install
    
    pip list (should indicate PyQt5, sip)
    
    or, better (NOTE everything is case-sensitive):
        
        pip list | grep sip
        
        pip list | grep PyQt5
        
        
................................
5.1.3 PyQt5.sip extension module:
................................
    Use PyQt5_sip-12.9.1
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

    pip show PyQt5-sip <-- verifies that PyQt5 sip module is installed
    
    NOTE: You may have to rebuild Pyt5.sip after rebuilding PyQt5 itself
    
    Also, pip list | grep PyQt5 shoudl now report both PyQt5 and PyQt5-sip
    packages.
    
    
After installing pip requirements below, test that PyQt5  was installed OK
by launching 'jupyter qtconsole' - Qt widgets should have the style used by your
desktop.

NOTE: 2023-01-14 22:10:08
Building (and using) PyQt5-5-15.7 : still needs to be built locally
    WITH scipyenv ACTIVE:   
    install sip directly from PyPI: pip install sip
    install PyQt5-builder for PyPI: pip install PyQt5-builder
    download PyQt5-5.15.7.tar.gz from PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/#files
        extract the archive, cd to the source tree then run sip-install --qmake=`which qmake-qt5`
        (this will detect and use the pyproject.toml and project.py files located 
         in the PyQt5-5-15.7 source tree)
        if succesful, you DO NOT need to separately build PyQt5_sip module
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 BUILD AND INSTALL BOOST LIBRARIES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(OPTIONAL; you can use the system-wide boost libraries installed by your system's
software management, HOWEVER this may mean you need to rebuild VIGRA after 
upgrading your OS)

NOTE: Optional, ONLY IF if the system-wide boost libraries are not available for the
version of Python used to build vigranumpy, below. This may include the situation
where some symbols are not found when linking against system-wide boost libs.

NOTE: Better to do build it locally, to insulate against system-wide library 
upgrades especially on Tumbleweed

Download 7z archive of boost sources from boost.org extract in VIRTUAL_ENV/src
-> will create 'boost_X_Y_Z' directory with X, Y, Z being the version tag

cd to the directory containing the extracted boost sources

On Linux :
    ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$VIRTUAL_ENV --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python3.9 --with-python-root=/usr/local
    ./b2 --prefix=$VIRTUAL_ENV install

    ATTENTION: make sure you point to the correct Python directories; when using
    a distribution-supplied Python stack, this is usually installed in /usr, e.g.:
    
    --with-python=/usr/bin/python3.10 --with-python-root=/usr

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3 BUILD AND INSTALL NODEJS node-v15.6.0.tar.gz (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (OPTIONAL, required to use bokeh with NEURON and jupyterlab; however, 
   installing nodejs via pip might just be enough)
  
  NOTE: this is independnet of, and not require for, Vigra - it can be built later
  
  Download source archive node-v15.6.0.tar.gz 
  NOTE: to use with Python 3.10 you need node-v16.14.0.tar.gz
  
  Extract in src -> creates the drectory node-v16.14.0 (or node-v15.6.0)
  
  cd into the extracted source tree then run:
      
      ./configure --prefix=$VIRTUAL_ENV > config_output 2>&1
      make -j4
      make doc
      make install
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4 BUILD AND INSTALL VIGRA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

....................................
5.4.1 Clone git repo in the src directory:
....................................
    
git clone https://github.com/ukoethe/vigra.git

create an out-of-source build tree, also in src:

mkdir vigra-build && cd vigra-build

....................................
5.4.2 Patch vigra sources - NOTE: THIS IS NECESSARY with the latest hdf5 libraries
....................................

See scipyen/doc/install/vigra_patches/README for details. 

Briefly, you need to patch src/hdf5impex.cxx if using hdf5 >= 1.11

Other patches needed are for Python source code

....................................
5.4.3 configure the build
....................................

cmake-gui ../vigra

        At first run click "configure" then as cmake variables are set or edited
        as below, press "configure" again
        
        In cmake-gui:
            * search for configuration variables containing the string 'INSTALL'
            (without quotes) and adjust them to point to the real path of your
            $VIRTUAL_ENV e.g., set the following variables as follows:
            CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=) /home/user/scipyenv
            
            * set LIB_SUFFIX (-DLIB_SUFFIX=) 64 (optional; both lib and lib64 are added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH by the pyenv script)
                    
            * in the "WITH" group, make sure the following are checked (i.e. True): 
            boost-thread, boost-graph, vigranumpy, openexr, valgrind
            
            NOTE:
                1. openexr is optional only of you plan to use openEXR images
                2. valgrind is optional, only is planning to debug software at
                C++ level
            
            WARNING BOOST: if you have built boost inside the virtual environment
            then make sure to point to THOSE libraries inside cmake-gui.
            
                NOTE: the various boost*_DIR variables refer to the boost cmake 
                directory (for a locally built boost this is in 'lib' directory)
    
            * press configure until all options are satisfied (i.e. nothing is
            highlighted in red anymore) - NOTE: this is a recursive process
            
            * finally, press "Generate" and quit cmake-gui

    vigranumpycore, unless the directory containing the boost python library is 
    included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
    
    This directory is usually the 'lib' subdirectory of the virtual environment
    tree.
    
    The '.scipyenrc' bash script, which is sourced by Scipyen launch bash 
    script, takes care of that (see make_script_links.sh in this directory)
    
    NOTE 3: vigra will NOT be listed in pip list, although it will be available
    to `import vigra` in a Python or Juyter session
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5. BUILD AND INSTALL PyTables (tables)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is REQUIRED if you are using a built Python stack (see above), but might be
helpful when using a virtual environment created with a system-wide python stack.

To install a binary package run

    pip install tables
    
otherwise, read on.

NOTE: PyTables are available as 'tables'; to use you must 'import tables'
gh repo clone PyTables/PyTables
(or: git clone https://github.com/PyTables/PyTables.git)
cd PyTables
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

Check that importing tables doesn't crash the interpreter:
    
    python
    
    >>> import tables
    >>>
    
    NOTE: do not import tables while in the PyTables source directory!!!
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.6 BUILD AND INSTALL NEURON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL: Only if you want to use NEURON/Python from within Scipyen.

5.6.1: clone git repo

git clone https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn

5.6.2 make out-of-source built tree

mkdir nrn-build && cd nrn-build

5.6.3 configure the build

cmake-gui ../nrn
"Configure" will also pull iv, coreneuron

Example (as of 2022-02-16 12:25:17 on Tumbleweed 20220213) 
    NOTE: SOME OF THESE MAY ONLY BE AVAILABLE AFTER SELECTING CORENEURON

    NOTE: for more recent nrn repos make sure all INSTALL variables in cmake point to
    $VIRTUAL_ENV/xxx instead of /usr/local/xxx
        
5.6.4 build & install

    make 
    make install

    NOTE: Run the following in order to properly install neuron python modules 
    inside the site-packages corresponding  to the environment's python version
    (installs nrnpython in site-packages)
    
    cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn-build/src/nrnpython
    
    python setup.py install 
    
    NOTE: This is IMPORTANT, especially when rebuilding NEURON after machine
    migration (either to a new distribution or distribution version)
    
    NOTE: Optional: Build neuron documentation locally and install locally 
        (see $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn/docs/README.md)
    
        pip3 install -r $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn/docs/docs_requirements.txt
    
        (installs required python packages (e.g.commonmark, sphinx-rtd-theme, 
        recommonmark, plotly, etc) inside the virtual environment; these are 
        also included in the pip requirements files described at point 4.3. and 
        in the PREAMBLE)
    
        cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn-build
        make docs 
        
            (NOTE conversion of some jupyter notebooks this may fail --> 
             until this is solved, please use the online documentation)
    
        Optionally, copy/move (or, better still, make a symbolic link) 
        $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn/docs/_build to $VIRTUAL_ENV/doc/neuron
    

===============================================================================
6. Create Scipyen launch desktop icon
===============================================================================
Create a symbolic link of $HOME/scipyen/scipyen

Drag and drop Scipyen.desktop to the desktop/panel/application menu editor.


Finally the $VIRTUAL_ENV directory tree should look like this:
    
  $HOME

                    |   |
                    |   -- vigra-build
                    |   |
                    |   -- sip-xxx
                    |   |
                    |   -- PyQt5-xxx
                    |   |
                    |   -- PyQt5_sipxxx
                    |
