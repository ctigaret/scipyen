To run Scipyen the following requirements must be met:
    
    Python 3.9.+ installed on the local machine.
    
    A python virtual environment (created with virtualenv, NOT conda/miniconda/anaconda or venv)
    
    Third party software
    
    To install all of these, read the following files in this directory:
        
    For GNU/Linux platforms:  INSTALL
    
    For Windows (10+):        INSTALL for Windows.txt
    
    
Since Python 3.9 is a bit ahead of the curve for the current Linux distribution
(on this machine, OpenSUSE Leap 15.2/15.3/Tumbleweed) I decided it is best to
build Python from sources - it doesn't take long - and install it in /usr/local/
(by calling `make altinstall`).
