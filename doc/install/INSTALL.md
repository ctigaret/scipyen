**NOTE:** If you read this, this means you already have a local clone of the 
Scipyen repository.

## Preamble

Scipyen requires Python >= 3.9 and is meant to run inside a virtual python 
environment. The `virtualenv` facility is recommended.

This script will create the virtual environment and install any required third
party software INSIDE the virtual environment. 

**WARNING:** 
Scipyen repository ***SHOULD NOT*** be stored inside the virtual environment directory!

**NOTE:**
The script itself requires a few other command line tools - these are 
supplied by the Linux distribution and usually are installed by default, but 
it is worth checking that they are available beforehand:

  • `date` (usually are installed by default)
  
  • `virtualenv` python package
  
  • [`glow`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) (to display [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents on the console)

  • development tools: `cmake`, `make`, C++ compiler suite, assembler, etc., see below.
## Usage

Assuming Scipyen is cloned inside `${HOME}/scipyen` launch the script like this:

```bash
sh ${HOME}/scipyen/doc/install/install_test.sh
```
### Script options
* `--install_dir=DIR` - specifies a directory where the virtual environment will be created (default is `${HOME}`)
* `--environment=NAME` - specifies a custom name for the virtual environment; (default is `scipyenv.x.y.z` where `x`, `y`, and `z` are the `python` interpreter version numbers"
* `--with_neuron` - when present, will install neuron python from PyPI. See also:
    - https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
    - https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/
    - https://pypi.org/project/NEURON/
* `--build_neuron` - when present, will build neuron python locally.
* `--with_coreneuron` - when present, local `neuron` build will use `coreneuron` (by default, `coreneuron` is not used). 
This option has effect only when `neuron` is built locally. For details about `coreneuron` see
    https://github.com/BlueBrain/CoreNeuron
* `--jobs=N` where `N` is an integer `>= 0`; enables parallel tasks during building 
of `PyQt5` and `neuron` (default is `4`)
* `--reinstall=N` whene `N` is one of `pyqt5`, `vigra` ,`neuron`; (re)installation or (re)building of any of these components;
can be passed more than once.
* `-h | -? | --help` shows a brief help message then quit
* `--about` shows this document on the console (requires `glow`).
    
    
## Description
Scipyen requires third party software installed in a virtual `python` environment.

### Needed Python packages
Some of this is available as Python packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) - hence installable via `pip`. 
The required packages are listed in the file `pip_requirements.txt` in this directory.

**ATTENTION:**
The actual `pip` tool to be used is `pip3` (i.e. for `python` version 3 and later). 
A better (as in more explicit) solution is to call (see [pip user guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/) for details):
    
```bash
python3 -m pip <... pip commands & options ...>
```
### Software that may have to be built locally
Other third party software may not be available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), or needs to be built
locally (inside the virtual environment), provided that dependencies are 
installed on the host computer:

#### [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) - Python bindings for `Qt5` toolkit
These are necessary for `Scipyen`'s GUI.

* On Windows, this can be installed via `pip` directly from [the PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) by calling
      
      ```sh
      python3 -m pip install PyQt5
      ```

* **NOTE:** On some Linux distributions installation via `pip` may fail, in particular
when the expected Qt project build tool `qmake` is available under a different 
name (e.g., `qmake-qt5`); in this case a local build is necessary.

Local `PyQt5` build is also useful for a custom selection of `Qt` components, and
for a better integration of `Scipyen`'s GUI with the desktop look and feel
when using `KDE/Plasma` desktop.
    - To build `PyQt5` locally in Lnux the following dependencies are needed
    - build toolchain (e.g. `make`, GNU c++ compiler etc)
    - development packages for `Qt5` - including `qmake` (!)
    - Python >= 3.10, `cython`
    - Follow instructions given on the [PyQt5 home page](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html).

**WARNING:**
By default, this script uses parallel compilation to build PyQt5 locally. 
In some circumstances this may crash the build process with an error like the one below:

```sh
      {standard input}: Assembler messages: 
      {standard input}: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted 
      {standard input}:1353: Error: unbalanced parenthesis in operand 1.
```
      
The error is likely generated by a race condition (the assembler triying to process 
a file that is incomplete at that particular stage in the build).

If this happens, then pass `--jobs=N` option to this script with `N` a small number 
(half the number of cores is a good guess) or even `0`.

#### [VIGRA](http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/) - C++ library for computer vision
This library privides `python` bindings (`vigranumpy`) that are used by `Scipyen` code for image analysis and processing.

However, there are no `vigranumpy` packages available as of this time 
(2023-03-23) and Therefore, VIGRA library and its python bindings MUST be built
locally.

This requires a few dependencies listed [here](http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/doc-release/vigra/Installation.html), 
which include [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/), [`boost C++`](https://www.boost.org/), [`cython`](https://cython.org/),
[`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) (*NOTE* that this is installed as per `pip_requirements.txt` file),
[`fftw3`](https://www.fftw.org/), [`libtiff`](http://simplesystems.org/libtiff/),
[`libpng`](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) (also available [here](https://libpng.sourceforge.io/index.html)),
[`libjpeg`](https://libjpeg.sourceforge.net/), and the *recommended* [`HDF5`](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/),
[`doxygen`](https://www.doxygen.nl/).


The script clones the latest [`vigra github`](http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/) 
repository and builds it locally.

#### [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) simulation environment.
The `python` interface in recent versions of [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
enables Scipyen to launch and operate with `NEURON`. This interoperability 
is still at an incipient stage, therefore `NEURON` is **NOT** installed by default.

To enable `NEURON`, pass either `--with_neuron` or `--build-neuron` options to the install
script.

* The `--with-neuron` option simply installs the currently available `NEURON python` 
package from its [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/NEURON/).
* The `--build-neuron` option builds `NEURON` locally from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn)
    - For dependencies and options to customize the build, see [here](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/master/docs/install/install_instructions.md)
    - When built locally, `NEURON` can be configured to use [The BlueBrain Project's](https://github.com/BlueBrain) [`coreneuron`](https://github.com/BlueBrain/CoreNeuron).
    

## Environment customization
If you want to add or remove packages manually, you can do so using `pip`; if 
you think these changes are worth propagating to the main scipyen repository
then please inform the main author ([Cezar Tigaret](tigaretc@cardiff.ac.uk)). 

**WARNING:** Please be advised that all calls to `pip` for package installation 
or removal should be done **with the python virtual environment activated**. The 
author(s) cannot advise on possible troubleshooting when packages are installed
outside the virtual environment.

## What the script does
The script performs the following steps:

1. Creates a virtual environment if necessary, then activates it
2. Installs python packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) according to the [`./pip_requirements.txt`](pip_requirements.txt) file in this directory
3. Download the latest PyQt5 sdist, build a wheel locally and installs it
4. Clones vigra git repository, build and install it
5. Optionally, installs neuron from PyPI or clones the neuron git repository, builds and install it.


**NOTE:** Steps 2 - 5 also generate a local "flag" (saved as hidden files 
in the top directory of the environment) such that should something go wrong
in a particular step, the steps sucessfully executed prior to the fault will 
be skipped on a subsequent run.

These flags are `.pipdone`, `.pyqtdone`, `.vigradone`, and `.nrndone`.

Should you want to re-run a (previously sucessful) step, just remove the 
corresponding flag from the environment directory and call this script again.
