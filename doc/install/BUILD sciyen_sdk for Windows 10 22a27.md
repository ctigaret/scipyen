Problem solved by building VIGRA against statically-built png libraries
(libpng-a.lib);
(should check if there are issues with building libpng from github as
shared lib on Windows -i.e. as dll)

All other dependencies of VIGRA (ZLIB, TIFF, JPEG, HDF5) were built dynamically
and installed (as with static libpng) in scipyen_sdk.

These dependencies were built as follows (these are general/generic steps;
details for each library are given below; the list here assumes each step works
w/o trouble):

 1. activate the scipyen with VS2019 environment (call "scipyact_vs64", see below)

 2. clone their git repository in a place e.g. "scipyen_sdk_src"
    this will create the source tree (e.g., "scipyen_sdk_src\vigra")

 3. create an out-of-source build tree (e.g., "vigra-build" alongside "vigra" in
    the "scipyen_sdk_src" directory)

 4. cd to the build tree and launch cmake-gui to configure, then generate a
 VisualStudio2019 solution for x64 platform

 5. from cmake-gui launch VStudio (press "Open Project")

 6. Inside VStudio:

* At the toolbar select "Release" and "x64" (NOTE for libpng, "Release Library" was selected)

* In Solution explorer select ALL_BUILD solution (or project), build it

* In solution explorer, select INSTALL solution (or project), build it.



It turns out one can archive scipyen_sdk as a zip file and carry it over to
another Windows 10 machine.

The "vigranumpy" python package is installed in scipyenv\Lib\site-packages\vigra
on the build machine. This package can also be archived as zip file and carried
over to another Windows 10 machine. On the new (target) machine the zip file
needs to be extracted and its contents placed in the equivalent "site-packages"
(sub)directory of the "scipyenv" virtual environment created on the target
machine.

NOTE that "scipyenv\Lib\site-packages" is created automatically WHEN INSTALLING
3rd party pythyon packages in the virtual environment, using "pip"; therefore,
these packages need to be installed first, by calling:
    pip install -r <pip_requirements>

where <pip_requirements> is the name of the requirements text file FOR WINDOWS,
located in "scipyen\doc\install" directory.


Finally, the batch scripts scipyact.bat, scipyact_vs64.bat and scipyen.bat only
need to be edited to point to thew correct location of scipyen_sdk directory.

NOTE that scipyact_vs64.bat is ONLY used to build the "scipyen_sdk" tree, from
sources (located in "scipyen_sdk_src").

To use scipyen one only needs to call scipyact.bat first, then "scipyen.bat".

AVOID building on networked drive - on a virtual machine, create a 2nd VDI image
for a 2nd partition (~100 GiB)

Building on network drive will:
1. slow down the process
2. interfere with building processes (e.g. HDF5 and VIGRA)

## 2022-01-26 18:48:50
Build attemps apparently works but launching scipyen fails with:

    python.exe - Ordinal Not Found
    the ordinal 169 could not be located in tghe dynamic link library
    e:zscipyen_sdk\bin\libpng16.dll

and, at command line:

    Traceback (most recent call last):

    File "e:\scipyen\scipyen.py", line 16, in <module>
        path_to_vigraimpex = win32api.GetModuleFileName(win32api.LoadLibrary(vigraimpex_mod))
        pywintypes.error: (182, 'LoadLibrary', 'The operating system cannot run %1.')

        
This was replicated on two Windows10 virtual machines.

##### 2022-01-26 20:46:50
This might have something to do with INSTALL projects overwriting runtime dlls in scipyen_sdk

#### Workaround: build libpng as static libraries, then link VIGRA against these.

# Tools for building scipyen dependencies.
* * *
These must be installed system-wide (make sure there is enough space on C:\drive)
(for convenience, installer are provided in the "DownloadsForScipyen" bundle;
 below I give the details of the version used, but you <b>may</b> use a more
 recent version)

## python-3.9.7 -- with options:
* for everyone
* raise the limit on PATH

<b>NOTE</b>: scipyen is written with <b>Python3.9</b> in mind, and some of its dependencies
(boost, vigra) were build against <b>this</b> version of Python.
The code has not yet been tested against Python 3.10 or newer.

## git
Download from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

    If you choose to install these, then edit
    scipyact.bat, vs64.bat and scipyact_vs64.bat
    to append:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\MPI\Include to %INCLUDE%
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\MPI\Lib to %LIB% and %LIBPATH%
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft MPI\Bin to %PATH%

## nasm: (for building jpeg)
Get nasm-2.15.05-installer-x64.exe from [here](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.15.05/win64/nasm-2.15.05-installer-x64.exe)

## flex and bison - required to build neuron
Download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/)
I use the win_flex_bison-latest.zip
Extract win_bison.exe and win_flex.exe to %USERPROFILE%\Scripts

## msys2-64bit - required for radline & termcap, see below
Download installer from [here](https://www.msys2.org/)
Run the installer, follow the instruction [here](https://www.msys2.org/)
* make sure you run it after first installation ("Run MSYS2 Now")
* you may want to choose another drive (it will easily eat uo a few GiB of your
disk space)

## readline & termcap - required for building NEURON; supplied via msys2-mingw-w64-x86_64
* start MSYS2-MinGW64 from the Start menu
* run pacman -Su
* see below under NEURON heading for details

NOTE: Readline and termcap libraries are in XXX:\msys64\mingw64\include, lib, etc.
where XX si the drive where you installed MSYS2

* * *
# Build the sdk tree
* * *

## Create a python virtual environment 
### Choose a drive with enough space (> 10 GiB) for the sdk sources

E.g.:

    e:\>virtualenv scipyenv

### Make scipyen_sdk and scipyen_sdk_src directories

    e:\>mkdir scipyen_sdk
    e:\>mkdir scipyen_sdk_src
    
NOTE: From here on, scipyen_sdk will be referred to as "SDK" and scipyen_sdk_src
as "SDK". <b>Make sure you don't confuse them!</b>

### Clone scipyen git repo

    e:\>git clone https://github.com/ctigaret/scipyen.git

#### clone master and dev branches; remain on master branch
If planning to contribute to Scipyen code please fork it on GitHub then raise
pull requests.
    
    cd scipyen
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout dev
    git pull
    

### Install batch script files

Make directory Scripts in %USERPROFILE% (that is, in your home directory)
and copy there the following:
        
        scipyact.bat
        scipyact_vs64.bat
        vs64.bat
        scipyen.bat
        


#### Purpose of these scripts:
scipyact.bat - activates the python virtual environment
        MUST be called before launghing scipyen
        
scipyact_vs64.bat - actvated the python virtual environment 
        AND the developer environment (under Visual Studio 2019)
        
scipyen.bat - launches Scipyen
        MUST be called AFTER calling scipyact.bat

scipyen_desktop.bat - combines scipyact with scipyen - useful to make it
a shortcut (e.g. on Desktop, StartMenu, or Windows TaskBar)

NOTE: A shortcut (Sciipyen.lnk) is already provided. Use it but make sure
you set the correct paths (right-click -> Properties)

If possible, you may want to change the icon to use the one supplied here
(pythonbackend.ico)


EDIT these scripts to ensure the locations are correct; this should be
self-explanatory.

Also ensure the paths to the Python environment are correct
    (i.e. %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39)

Add %USERPROFILE%\Scripts to your PATH:
    use Settings -> search for environment -> Edit environment variables
    for your account -> select PATH in top half of dialog -> click Edit ->
    -> add c:\Users\<xxx>\Scripts
    
Copy scipyen_startup.py into the SDK directory.

    
Restart the command prompt.
    
## Install pip requirements in the virtual environment

    
### Activate the virtual environment, e.g.:

    e:\>scipyact
    
### Call 'pip install -r pip_requirements_windows10.txt
The requirements file is found in scipyen\doc\install
    
    e:\>pip install -r e:\scipyen\doc\install\pip_requirements_windows10.txt
    
(be prepared to wait)
    
When all is done, check that you have a working jupyter-qtconsole
     
* * *
## Build and install VIGRA
* * *

Open a new command prompt, activate sciyen WITH VidualStudio development

    e:\>scipyen_vs64

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Install vigra dependencies in scipyen_sdk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vigra dependencies tree:
    
    vigra   <-  fftw3
                libjpeg <-  zlib
                libpng  <-  zlib 
                libtiff
                hdf5    <-  zlib
                boost_python <- boost <- icu (skipped)
                openexr (optional) <- Imath, openssl, icu
                python (done above)
                numpy, sphinx, nose (done above via pip)
                cmake (done above)
                
#### zlib

2022-01-26 19:18:15
use zlib github (Hermes)

    git clone https://github.com/madler/zlib.git
    
make out-of-source build tree for cmake:

    mkdir zlib-build
    cd zlib-build
    cmake-gui ..\zlib

1st time configure => select VS2019, x64, native compilers
    then check destinations to go under e:\scipyen_sdk
    configure -> generate -> open project (VS2019)
    select Release + x64
    Build ALL_BUILD
    Build INSTALL



#### libpng

2022-01-26 18:50:56 OBSOLETE, use 2022-01-26 22:54:42 below
using libpng github (on Hermes):

    git clone https://github.com/glennrp/libpng.git
    
make out-of-source build tree

    mkdir libpng-build
    cd libpng-build
    cmake-gui ..\libpng

set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to e:z\scipyen_sdk
configure -> generate -> open project (opens with VStudio)
    Select Release + x64
    Build ALL-BUILD
    Build INSTALL

2022-01-26 22:54:42 - USE THIS RECIPE
try this:

    git clone https://github.com/winlibs/libpng.git

Modify libpng/projects/vstudio2019/zlib.props to point to the zlib source above.

In scipyact_vs64 call devenv -> open libpng/projects/vstudio2019/vstudio.sln
choose Release Library + x64 (i.e. build static)
in solution explorer select libpng -> Build

Later, configure vigra-build (using cmake-gui) to point to the static zlib and
libpng_a libraries in "libpng/projects/vstudio2019/x64/Release Library"

... AND IT WORKS!

### jpeg - requires nasm, see above

    git clone https://github.com/winlibs/libjpeg.git

build with cmake-gui in out-of-source tree

    cd scipyen_sdk_src
    mkdir libjpeg-build
    cd libjpeg-build

    cmake-gui ..\libjpeg -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=e:\scipyen_sdk -DDEPENDENCY_SEARCH_PREFIX=e:\scipyen_sdk
    
=> select VS 16 2019 + default native compilers

configure -> select installation to <i>your_path</i>\scipyen_sdk

set WITH_JPEG7 and WITH_JPEG8 ON

configure until no more red lines; check no errors

generate -> check no errors

open project => opens VS2019 ->
    select release + x64
    Build ALL_BUILD
    Build INSTALL
            
    
### fftw3

Download fftw-3.3.5-dll64.zip from [here](http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html) then extract to scipyen_sdk_src\fftw3


    cd into fftw3 
    
Run:

    lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3-3.def
    lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3f-3.def
    lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3l-3.def

then copy:

    copy *.exe ..\..\scipyen_sdk\bin\
    copy *.dll ..\..\scipyen_sdk\bin\
    copy *.lib ..\..\scipyen_sdk\lib\
    copy *.def ..\..\scipyen_sdk\lib\
    copy *.exp ..\..\scipyen_sdk\lib\
    copy *.h  ..\..\scipyen_sdk\include\
        
Then copy COPYING, COPYRIGHT, NEWS, README* to %SDK%\share\doc\fftw3\

### tiff - requires jpeg;
Will be buit wothout support for OpenGL and deflate.

In e:\scipyen_sdk_src run:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff.git
    
build with cmake in out-of-source tree => generate VS2019 solution

    mkdir libtiff-build
    cd libtiff-build
    
    cmake-gui -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=e:\scipyen_sdk -DDEPENDENCY_SEARCH_PREFIX=e:\scipyen_sdk ..\libtiff
        
configure: first run: select VS 16 2019, X64;
configure, set install_prefix to scipyen_sdk,
configure -> generate -> open project opes VS2019
    select Release + x64
    Build -> ALL_BUILD
    Build INSTALL
        
Check that it works:
    From [here](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/images.html) download [images](https://download.osgeo.org/libtiff/pics-3.8.0.tar.gz)

unpack with 7zip => %SDK%\share\libtiffpic

open command prompt, then 

    cd %SDK%\share\libtiffpic
    tiffcp -lzw cramps.tif x.tif
    tiffcmp cramps.tif x.tif
    tiff2pdf -o cramps.pdf cramps.tif
    tiff2bw jello.tif jello_bw.tif

also you may run tiffinfo on all tif files in this directory

### boost - built w/o support for icu; requires MPI - see above

Download boost_1_77_0.7z from [here](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/more/getting_started/windows.html#get-boost)
and extract to scipyen_sdk_src => will create scipyen_sdk_src\boost_1_77_0

Activate scipyen_vs64 environment

Create the b2 Boost.Build program

    cd boost_1_77_0\tools\build
    bootstrap
    .\b2 --prefix=e:\scipyen_sdk_src\Boost.Build toolset=msvc install

Build & install boost

    cd e:\scipyen_sdk_src\boost_1_77_0


Run:
        
    ..\Boost.Build\bin\b2 toolset=msvc threading=multi address-model=64 variant=release link=shared --prefix=e:\scipyen_sdk --build-type=complete msvc install

NOTE: always use the same toolset setting!
    
This will install:
* boost headers (*.hpp) in SDK\include\boost_1_77_0\boost
    => add this path e:\scipyen_sdk\include\boost_1_77_0\
        to the relevant variables when building vigra

* the *.dll and *.lib files in SDK\lib
    
### hdf5
See [here](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Building+HDF5+with+CMake) for instructions.

Recommended download: CMake-hdf5-1.12.0.zip, but you may wish to use CMake-hdf5-1.10.6.zip; in this case DISREGARD the instructions to patch vigra for HDF5 below

Extract CMake-hdf5-1.12.0.zip to e:\scipyen_sdk_src
    => creates  e:\scipyen_sdk_src\CMake-hdf5-1.12.0 directory
    
    cd CMake-hdf5-1.12.0
    
Create a build script by running the following line:
ATTENTION: NO COMMAS in the value to the -S option !

    e:\scipyen_sdk_src\CMake-hdf5-1.12.0>echo ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS201964,INSTALLDIR=e:\scipyen_sdk -C Release -V -O hdf5.log > build.bat
    
Run the build script

    e:\scipyen_sdk_src\CMake-hdf5-1.12.0>build
    
This will generate a zip file inside the CMake-hdf5-1.12.0 directory:
    HDF5-1.10.6-win64.zip
    
extract and merge its contents with the correspondding directories in e:\scipyen_sdk

exceptions are:
    * all document files in the root HDF5-1.10.6-win64 directory should go to
        e:\scipyen_sdk\share\doc\hdf5
    
    * DO overwrite all files in the destination, when asked
    (this will replace zlib from above with a new one - it's OK)
        
### VIGRA - without OpenEXR support

    e:\scipyen_sdk_src>git clone https://github.com/ukoethe/vigra.git

* Patch the vigra source tree as per scipyen\doc\install\vigra_patches\README

* Create out-of-source build tree:

    e:\scipyen_sdk_src>mkdir vigra-build
    e:\scipyen_sdk_src>cd vigra-build

* Run:

    cmake-gui ..\vigra -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=e:\scipyen_sdk -DDEPENDENCY_SEARCH_PREFIX=e:\scipyen_sdk
        
in CMake GUI you must set:
    Boost_PYTHON_LIBRARY to 
        e:\scipyen_sdk\lib\boost_python39-vc142-mt-x64-1_77.lib
    
deselect the following:
    BUILD_TESTS, AUTOEXEC_TESTS, TEST_VIGRANUMPY

set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to e:\scipyen_sdk
set LIB_SUFFIX to 64

set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
    e:\scipyen_sdk
    
Check all other libraries and paths are correct, especially for the 
dependencies built above (HDF5, jpeg, tiff, png)

Check locations for Python are correct (yes, use the Python.exe located in the 
scipyenv directory).

Configure repeatedly until no more red lines in the GUI.
Check the output to have vigranumpy built and installed

Finally press Generate to generate VStudio solution, then
Click "open project" => Opens VStudio
in VStudio, make sure Release + x64 are selected
Select ALL_BUILD then run Build/Build Solution
    
The doc_cpp.vcxproj and doc_python.vcxproj will likely FAIL
Ignore that

Then in Solution explorer select INSTALL project, right-click, build.

This will install:
    header files in scipeyn_sdk\include (including "windows.h")
    vigranumpy in e:\scipyenv\lib\site-packages\vigra
    vigraimpex.lib in e:\scipyen_sdk\lib64
    vigraimpex.dll in e:\scipyen_sdk\bin
    doc in e:\scipyen_sdk\doc
        
        
* * *

## NEURON

    git clone https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn

make out-of-source build tree in scipyen_sdk_src:

    mkdir nrn-build
    cd nrn-build
    
Edit nrn\cmake\ReleaseDebugAutoFlags.cmake to disable the FatalError
message; place "set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release)" instead

    cmake-gui ..\nrn
    
make sure you have installed msys2-mingw64, see [here](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/issues/319)
(you can skip the "pacman git" stage - we already have git)
<b>WARNING</b>: <i>The above page is a bit involved, tread carefully!</i>

pip3 install -r $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn/docs/docs_requirements.txt

    (installs required python packages (e.g.commonmark, sphinx-rtd-theme,
        recommonmark, plotly, etc) inside the virtual environment)

cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn-build
make docs (NOTE this may fail --> no problems !)

    Optionally, copy/move (or, better make a symbolic link)
    $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn/docs/_build to $VIRTUAL_ENV/doc/neuron
