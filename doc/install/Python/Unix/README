###############################################################################

NOTE: This is for building Python (3.9.7 or later) on Unix/GNU Linux, with 
particulars for the OpenSUSE platform (the machine where this was written).

For Windows 10 see the accompanying "README.txt" in the "../Windows" directory

=========================================
Install prerequisites for building Python
=========================================

Use the distribution's Software manager (e.g. YaST/zypper on OpenSuSE, yum, apt,
etc., on others) search for, and install TOGETHER WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING 
"devel" PACKAGES, the following:

    libnsl, 
    openssl (>= 1.1.1)
    tk
    sqlite3

Extract the Python source code archive (e.g., Python-3.9.7.tar.xz) into your
chosen place (e.g., ~/src)

The cd into the chosen Python source tree (e.g. ~/src/Python-3.9.7) and run
(in a Unix shell)

./configure --enable-optimizations --with-lto --enable-shared --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions > config_output 2>&1
# NOTE: VIGRA requires shared python library !!!
# NOTE: IPython requires the sqlite3 module

make

# run as superuser (either call su, or via sudo):

make altinstall # NOTE: DO NOT CALL make install !!!! (this will overwrite your
                #   ditribution's python3 executable)
                
                # NOTE: you could try to install Python locally somewhere under 
                # your own $HOME tree

ldconfig        # NOTE: required to update the records for the shared python library
                # NOTE: this MUST be run as superuser (administrator) which is
                # why it is a BAD IDEA to instal Pyton anywhere in your $HOME
                # tree
                
ATTENTION: DO NOT RUN 'make install' (it will overwrite/overshadow the 
distribution's own python executable and mess everything up)

By default, the build toolkit will install Python in /usr/local/ but you could
try to install it in a nonstandard location e.g. ~/Python

Both strategies MIGHT survive an OS upgrade if /usr/local/ or /home/ are on a 
partition distinct from root partition (where you install the OS). Even so, after
upgrading you MAY have to rebuild Python (especially if the upgrade brings new 
versions of gcc, nsl, oppenssl, sqlite3, tk, etc).

As a rule of thumb, ALWAYS REBUILD Python (and other Scipyen ependencies) after
an OS ugrade.

For details, see the accompanying 'README migrating' file in this directory.

If you decide to install Python in a non-standard place (e.g. ~/Python-3.9.7)
you MUST add this directory to your PATH (edit ~/.bashrc)

To run Scipyen YOU NEED TO MAKE AND ACTIVATE THE PYTHON ENVIRONMENT USING THE 
BUILT PYTHON.

================================================================================
VIRTUAL PYTHON ENVIRONMENT ACTIVATION SCRIPTS:
================================================================================

NOTE: These have been created with the assumption that the build was configured 
    using the default value for the '--prefix' option (which sets the FINAL 
    location of Python after installation). By default, this is '/usr/local'
    
    Should you decide to ./configure with a specific --prefix value (e.g. 
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Python-x.x.x) then you should modify the contents
    of these scripts accordingly.
    
    It is a BadIdea(TM) to install Pythnon DIRECTLY in $HOME (it will populate
    it with a lot of stuff, and may even overwrite scripts and binaries in your
    $HOME/bin).
    
    HOWEVER: Because you have to call ldconfig (as superuser) after make install,
    is is a BadIdea NOT to install Python in the default location (/usr/local)

Link the pyenv bash script to your $HOME/bin directory

You MUST NOT make this executable.

In your ~/.bashrc file (located in your HOME directory; this is hidden in 
your file manager unless you set it to display hidden files) add the following
line:

alias usepy='source $HOME/bin/pyenv'

This script IS REQUIRED to set up environment variables telling the Python 
interpreter where its extensions & platform dependent libraries are.

================================================================================
CREATE A VIRTUAL PYTHON ENVIRONMENT
================================================================================

You MUST create a virtual python environment specific for the version of Python
you are planning to use, for the following reasons:
    1. everything else that relies on the specifc Python version can properly 
    locate what it needs, without interference from the system's default Python
    interpreter
    2. Any Python packages installed specifically for the Python version using 
    the version-specifc 'pip' tool will not interfere (or worse, ovderwrite)
    system-wide packages

Do the following:
    1. Add $HOME/.local/bin LAST on your $PATH environment variable, if not 
    already there  
    
    CAREFUL! $HOME/.local/bin would also contain python executables you may
    have installed via the system's pip (using the '--user' option). In that
    case, locate an old virtualenv script in there are rename it e.g
    virtualenvX_Y were X and Y are the major and minor Python version 
    corresponding to it (these are found in the first line of the script)
    
    2. call the usepy with the desired python version (major.minor)
    
    3. run 'pip install --user virtualenv'
        NOTE: this will install an executable Python script called 'virtualenv'
        in $HOME/.local/bin
        
        If you want to have separate virtual environments for different Python
        versions then rename that script to 'virtualenvX_Y' where X and Y are 
        the major and minor version numbers of the specific Python you used to
        create the virtualenv script
        
    4. call virtualenvX_Y to generate a virtual environment with the desired
    Python version (you can omit the -p option there)
    
    5. Proceed with the installation of virtual environment activation scripts
    


Therefore, in your ~/.bashrc also create an alias to source the activation
script of the nbewly created Python environment AND set up the use of the built
Pyton (this sets up environment variables required for third party software used 
Scipyen).

For example, add the following line to ~/.bashrc:

alias scipyact39='source $HOME/scipyenv39/bin/activate && usepy 3.9'

(NOTE: This activated the virtual python environment AND makes it aware of where
the custom built Python stack is located)

(NOTE: adapt to reflect the correct path names on your machine)
