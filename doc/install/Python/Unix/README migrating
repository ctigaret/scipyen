This notes are for rebuilding Python and Scipyen dependencies on a machine that
was migrated or upgraded to a different Linux distribution.

The steps necessary to build Python and scipyenv (with dependencies) from scratch
see the accompanying README file in this directory.

In particular, Python MUST BE REBUILT e.g., , after migrating from OpenSUSE Leap 
15.2 to Tumbleweed (done so for Tumbleweed 20220213), so that packages that rely 
on Python's C API (ctypes) can work again. 

To rebuild Python:
    1. run `make clean` then `configure` (as in the accompanying README file),
    2. run `make` followed by `make altinstall` and `ldconfig`  

    This is because ALL binary code (including the various tests run during the 
    build process) must be built with the same version of the gcc compiler, 
    including the test code.

ATTENTION: Scipyen dependencies (3rd party software) that also need to be rebuilt
includes:
    
    NEURON
        
        To rebuild, activate the scipyen virtual environment (see the file 
        'INSTALL' in doc/install directory of the Scipyen git tree); it is best
        to refresh the cloned 'nrn' git repository, then create a NEW out-of-source
        build tree. 
        
        For example, assuming the sources are in $VIRTUAL_ENV/src:
            cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/nrn
            git checkout # NOTE: you should already be on the 'master' branch
            git pull     # NOTE: this updates the local repository, by pulling
                         # and merging all the changes
            cd ..
            mv nrn-build nrn-build-old
            mkdir nrn-build
            cd nrn-build
            cmake-gui ../nrn # NOTE: follow the instructions in the 
                             # $SCIPYEN/doc/install/INSTALL file, where $SCIPYEN
                             # is the directory with the cloned scipyen git repo.
