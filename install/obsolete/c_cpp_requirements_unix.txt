# FOOTNOTES:
# (1) 
#     on Windows, build from sources, possibly using VisualStudio 2019;
#     on Unix, install the corresponding devel packages using your distribution's
#     software manager
#     
# (2)
#     on Windows, build with stand-alone cmake-gui using VisualStudio2019 toolset
#     -> generate *.sln (solution) then build & install
#     
# (3) build from sources on Windows and Unix
# 
# (4) build from sources on Unix
#
# (5) PyQt5 can also be installed as a wheel using pip - recommended on Windows;
#       However, on Unix, and depending on the OS distribution, the PyQt5 modules
#       may NOT 'see' the system-wide  Qt5 modules (especially the style plugins).
# 
#       Therefore I prefer to build this from sources on Linux, which requires
#       the installation of several devel packages (not least of Qt5) then building
#       the sip library manually beforehand, followed by building of PyQt5 then 
#       Pyqt5.sip
