This file describes how to install scipyen and its dependencies in a virtual
environment (python3), independent of the system or local (i.e. "user") python
site packages.

The advantage of a virtual environment include the possibility of installing
build software directly in this environment (without administrator privileges,
and without interfering with system-wide or account-wide software).

This means the software can be uninstalled re-built, etc, without worrying about
the local account or system-wide interference.

Requires ~ 1 GiB in home directory (including source trees, see below)

Prerequisites:
--------------
a. For creating the virtual environment:
python3, python3-virtualenv, toml, setuptools, pip3, wheel

b. The following software must be built inside the virtual environment (see
    NOTE 2021-01-12 10:13:03 Separate builds, below):
    1. sip
    2. Pyqt5 - built using the host system's Qt5, but without the designer and 
        qml plugins, and without the qscintila component.
    3. PyQt5.sip module
    4. vigra and python bindings for vigra (vigranumpy)
    5. NEURON modelling software with python bindings
    

NOTE 2021-01-12 10:13:03 Separate builds
------------------------------------------
The source directories DO NOT need to be located inside the directory of the
virtual python environment; they can be placed in a source repository separate
from the environment itself, e.g. ~/scipyenv/src or ~/scipyenv-src.

However, both the build and installation processes MUST be run from a shell
with the virtual python environment activated (see points 1.2 and 1.3, below).

By separating source and environment directories the source packages can be
re-built for specific environments. 

NOTE: 2021-01-14 09:02:07 Variations for individual software libraries:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *** Vigra and neuron software ***

        These can be built "outside" the source directories (i.e. in build 
        directories outside the source tree).

        Out-of-source builds are recommended for both vigra and neuron. The
        build processes are run from inside the build directories as detailed for 
        Vigra (section 4) and NEURON (section 5) below. 

        - The builds are configured using 'cmake' or 'cmake-gui'.

        - 'make' performs the building (compiling and linking) of the software;

        - 'make install' will install the software in the environment directory 
        tree as per configuration as explained in sections 4 and 5.

        Other optional commands are explained in sections 4 and 5.

        NOTE 2021-01-12 11:15:51: all git repositories cloned below can be
        refreshed (e.g. git checkout master then git pull) followed by 
        rebuilding & installing

    *** sip, PyQt5, PyQt5_sip module and node ***
        These do not seem to support out-of-source builds. They must be unpacked
        in the src directory and built INSIDE the resulting subdirectory.

  1. Create Python 3 virtual environment
  ======================================
  
  1.1 Prerequisites and shell command:
  ------------------------------------
  
  shell command (assumes the python3, and NOT the python2 version of virtualenv
                 is installed on the system):
      
  virtualenv --system-site-packages scipyenv
  
  
  1.2 Activate the virtual environment --  everything below MUST be run under
  the activated virtual python environment
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cd scipyenv
  source bin/activate
  
  1.3 (Optional) make an activation command alias:
  -------------------------------------------------
      
      in ~/.bashrc enter the following line:
          
          alias scipyact='source $HOME/scipyenv/bin/activate'
          
    Then, to activate the scipyenv environment just type 'scipyact' command
    in the shell.
    
  The active environment will be indicated by its name in parantheses before the
  normal shell prompt, e.g.:
      
      (scipyenv) user@Host:~>
  
  NOTE: While the scipyen environment is active, it can be deactivated with the 
  'deactivate' shell command
  
  1.4 Create directories for source code
  --------------------------------------
  
  As per NOTE 2021-01-12 10:13:03 Separate builds and 
  NOTE: 2021-01-14 09:02:07 Variations for individual software libraries, the
  directory tree used in this README is as follows:
  
  $HOME
        |
        -- scipyenv
                    |
                    -- bin
                    |
                    -- include
                    |
                    -- lib
                    |
                    -- lib64 (symbolic link to $HOME/scipyenv/lib)
                    |
                    -- nrnipython
                    |
                    -- scipyen (the scipyen git repository)
                    |
                    -- scipyen_boilerplate
                    |
                    -- scipyen_not_staged
                    
                    -- src
                        |
                        -- nrn-build   
                        |
                        -- vigra-build
                        |
                        -- sipxxx
                        |
                        -- PyQt5xxx
                        |
                        -- PyQt5_sipxxx
        
    * the src directory inside the environment tree contains cloned git repositories
    and directories for out-of-source build of 3rd party software, see the README
    file in there
    
  2. Install sip, PyQt5 and PyQt5.sip module
  ===============================================
  
  2.1 Download sources, build and install sip, PyQt5 and PyQt5.sip modules
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE: check on the Riverbank computing website:
  https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download
  and
  https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
  
  before using wget - the versions available may not be the same as in the
  examples below
  
  Examples:
  sip v 5 (latest before PyQt6, which is in development for Qt6):
  wget 'https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Downloads/sip/sip-5.5.1.dev2011271026.tar.gz'
  
  WARNING: 2021-01-11 16:43:23:
      sip5.5.1 has been removed form the Riverbank Computing SIP download page.
      The most recent version is sip6.0.1. However, the build of PyQt5 with sip6
      installed fails. Therefore, TO BUILD PYQT5 USE SIP5.X ARCHIVE ALREADY 
      DOWNLOADED HERE.
    
      TODO: build sip6 and PyQt6 and check Scipyen still works - expect disruption
      oin 3rd party packages such as Jupyter qt console, etc. For the moment stick
      with PySt5/sip5.5.1
      
  PyQt5 but see WARNING: 2021-01-11 16:43:23:
  wget 'https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Downloads/PyQt5/PyQt5-5.15.3.dev2012141313.tar.gz'
  
  Pyqt5 sip extension module: 
  download source tar.gz archive from PyPI web site https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5-sip/
  
  Example (NOTE: 2021-01-11 18:07:03: bst downloded manually from the above site)
  wget 'https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/73/8c/c662b7ebc4b2407d8679da68e11c2a2eb275f5f2242a92610f6e5024c1f2/PyQt5_sip-12.8.1.tar.gz'
  
  2.2.1 Build sip

  tar xzvf sip-5.5.1.dev2011271026.tar.gz
  cd sip-5.5.1.dev2011271026/
  
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
  
  2.2.2 Build PyQt5
  ...................
  
  WARNING: 2021-01-11 17:50:54 see WARNING: 2021-01-11 16:43:23 :
    Requires sip5.5.1; fails to build if sip6.0.1 is installed.

  cd ..
  tar xzvf PyQt5-5.15.3.dev2012141313.tar.gz

  python configure.py --qmake=`which qmake-qt5` --no-designer-plugin --no-qml-plugin --no-qsci-api --no-python-dbus
  
  python dbus bindings are skipped because they tent to be install in a system directory
  
  # NOTE: installation fails when the installer script tries to install the 
   designer, qml plugins smd pythopn dbus extension in the system-wide Qt5 
   installation (but without root privileges) -- hence these are all disabled
  
  (enter 'yes' to accept the license)
  
  make
  make install
  
  2.2.3 Build Pyqt5.sip module
  .............................
  cd ..
  tar xzvf PyQt5_sip-12.8.1.tar.gz
  cd PyQt5_sip-12.8.1/
  
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
  
  pip show PyQt5-sip <-- veryfies that PyQt5 sip moduel is installed
  
  3. Build and install Node.js in the local virtual environment
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  (required to use bokeh with jupyterlab)
  
  3.1 Download Node.js source code archive from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
  
  --> node-v15.6.0.tar.gz
  
  
  cd ~/scipyenv-src
  tar xzf node-v15.6.0.tar.gz
  cd node-v15.6.0
  
  (make sure scipyenv environment is activated)
  
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/scipyenv
  make -j4
  make doc
  make install
  
  
  4. Install python packages inside the environment (via pip install ...)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE: because the environment was created for a python3 environemnt, pip and 
  pip3 are the same
  
  NOTE: do not use --user option because it will install packages 
    in ~/.local/lib/python-x.y/site-packages and therefore bypass the environment
    
  NOTE: is the virtual environemnt has been created with the --system-site-packages
  option, then you may want to pass the '-I' options to pip install command for
  those packages that are already installed systemwide

e.g. pip install -I numpy
    This may flag further needed dependencies, that will have to be installed
    in the environment.
    
    
  
    Package         Dependencies                
                    (installed alongside if not already present
                     NOTE: some dependencies are required
                     by multiple packages and, if installed, pip will verify 
                     their installed versions; therefore, these are listed below
                     only ONCE: the lists are not exhaustive representations of

    NOTE: 2021-06-12 15:46:34 
    jedi 0.18.0 is incompatible with IPython<=7.19; if you have IPython<=7.19 
    installed in scipyenv then force install an earlier jedi version:
        pip install jedi==0.17.2
        
        see also here: 
            https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1714

    jupyter_qtconsole_colorschemes
    
    NOTE: Scipyen does not aim to replicate the functionality in the jupyter 
        interfaces available - some people may find it easy(er) to work with 
        jupyter notebook and/or jupyterlab.
        
        jupyter notebook is already installed alongside jupyter; jupyterlab can 
        be installed separately.
        
        jupyter notebooks and/or jupyterlab are useful when trying out gui2 module
        in neuron package (for plotting outside of neuron's own gui)
        
    ipyparallel
    jupyter_cms     (woosh)
    jupyterlab      (immutables, contextvars, sniffio, dataclasses, anyio, jupyter-server,
                     json5, nbclassic, jupyterlab-server, )
    
    jupyterlab_templates
    
    jupyterthemes   for theming the jupyter notebook
    
    nodejs - requires installation of a more recent Node.js version (>- 12.0.0)
        in the local environment
        
    
    *** Install Python libraries for storing configuration options unrelated to the GUI:
        NOTE: this is still experimental - testing various configuration libraries
    
    confuse     (pyyaml)
        
        not used, not installed:
            config (pip install config) -- 
                recommended for use inside a virtual environment, which we use here
            
            dynaconf -- python library for software configuration framework, independent
                of the Qt5 framework
                * not very straightforward to use; 
                * not straightforward to permamently store changed configurations 
                    form inside the program
                    
            python-configuration -- alternative to config and dynaconf 
            python-configuration[toml,yaml] -- toml and yaml modules of the above
                * again, saving configuration to files from within the program not straightforward
                
    Optional jupyter kernels:
    octave_kernel   (metakernal)
    gnuplot_kernel
    matlab_kernel   (wurlitzer)
    
    Other modules - functionality complementary to NEURON:
        pyneuroml reader

    6.4 Build neuron, then install
    make
    make install
    
    properly install neuron python modules inside the site-packages corresponding
    to the environment's python version
    
    cd ~/scipyenv/src/nrn-build/src/nrnpython
    
    python setup.py install 
    (to install nrnpython in site-packages)
    
    Build neuron documentation locally and install locally (see ~/scipyenv-src/nrn/docs/README.md)
    
    cd ~/scipyenv-src/nrn
    pip3 install -r docs/docs_requirements.txt
        --> installs required python packages (e.g.commonmark, sphinx-rtd-theme, 
        recommonmark, etc)
            inside the virtual environment
    
    cd ~/scipyenv/src/nrn-build
    make docs
    
    Optionally, copy (or link, move) ~/scipyenv/src/nrn-build/docs to
    ~/scipyenv/doc/neuron
    
    
    7. Clone scipyenv (for now use the dev branch)
    ----------------------------------------------
    REQUIRES git software (system-wide installation) including gitk and git-gui
    
    7.1 install github cli (for Linux; other platforms may use github desktop app)
    (for various distributions see 
     https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)
    
        openSUSE/SUSE Linux (zypper)
            Install:

            sudo zypper addrepo https://cli.github.com/packages/rpm/gh-cli.repo
            sudo zypper ref
            sudo zypper install gh
            
    7.2 (in ~scipyenv, with environment activated)
    
    7.2.1 authenticate with github (if not already done)
        gh auth login ==> select GitHub.com, then when prompted enter username
            and password
            
    7.2.2 Clone scipyen
        gh repo clone ctigaret/scipyen
        
        Then cd into scipyen and verify local repo is uptodate with the relevant
        branches:
            git checkout master
            git pull
            git checkout dev
            git pull
            git checkout work
            git pull
            
        Finally, for development work:
            git checkout dev; make sure to git pull every time
            
    8. Link the nrnipython script (in scipyen/nrnipython):
        cd ~/scipyenv/bin
        ln -s ../scipyen/scipyen
        ln -s ../nrnipython/nrnipython nrnipython
        ln -s ../nrnipython/nrnipython nrnpython
        ln -s ../nrnipython/nrnipython nrnpy
        
        (the last two are just aliases of the first)
        
    9 link the scypien bash script (executable)
        cd ~/scipyenv/bin
        ln -s ../scipyen/scipyen scipyen
    
    10. Other software (optional)
    ----------------------------
    10.1 pygrace -  not installed
    
    10.2 pykde5 - not built, not installed 
        requires sipconfig module which doesn't exist anymore
    
    10.3 cvapp -- not installed, not used - import 3D data from NEURON directly

    python 3.9 (windows installer): choose to place executable on PATH
    virtualenv:
        C:\Users\xxx>pip install virtualenv
        C:\Users\xxx>virtualenv scipyenv
        C:\Users\xxx>cd scipyenv
        C:\Users\xxx>scipyenv\Scripts\activate -->
        (scipyenv) C:\Users\xxx\scipyenv>
        (scipyenv) C:\Users\xxx\scipyenv>pip install PyQt5 --> installs PyQt5-5.5.4, PyQt5-Qt5-5.15.2,PyQt5-sip-12.9.0
        ... proceed with python modules installation as above WHILE in 
        (scipyenv) C:\Users\xxx\scipyenv (i.e. with environment activated)
        
    Qt (Open source edition) - 
    visual studio community 2019 -  C++ environment only (use python from above, 
                                don't use visual studio's own python)
    
    
    Download vigra binary with sources and documentation for Visual Studio including dependencies
