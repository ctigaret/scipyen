1. when building vigra against hdf5 >= 1.12 NOTE signature change in the functions
in the family H5Oget_info_by_name* (declared in H5Opublic.h) -these now expect 
FOUR parameters:
    
hid_t loc_id, consyt char name *name, H5O_info1_t *ointo, unsigned fields, hid_t lapl_id

but hdf5impex.cxx calls H5Oget_info_by_name with only THREE ('fields' is missing)
I have inserted H5O_INFO_ALL fields flag , see hdf5impex_corrected_HDF5_get_type.cxx

Before building vigra, and ALWAYS AFTER cloning/pulling the vigra source git repo
make sure to replace vigra/src/impex/hdf5impex.cxx with this one.
