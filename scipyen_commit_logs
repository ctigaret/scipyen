ltp module:
===========
    work started on parsing ltp options


neoutils module:
===============
cursor functions for signal analysis (all based on vertical cursors, although
    crosshair cursors are accepted, as only their x and xwindow parameters are
    used)
    
    NOTE 1 the "time" is used in the loose sense of signal's domain. For 
    neo.AnalogSignal, "time" refers to the time domain of the signal, whereas
    the domain of datatypes.DataSignal may be some other physical measure (e.g.
    space, or frequency, etc)
    
    NOTE 2: all signals are column vectors; a multi-channel signal is a matrix
    with one channel per column, hence all channels share the signal's domain,
    have the same number of samples, and have the same python Quantity units.
    
    Thus they are NOT to be confused with neo.ChannelIndex.
    
    Functions based on a single cursor:
    ====================================
        * all take a neo.AnalogSignal or datatypes.DataSignal as first parameter
        
        * second parameter conveys the cursor's coordinate in the signal's 
            domain, and can be one of:
                    
                a SignalCursor (the coordinate is the cursor's x attribute)
                
                a tuple of 2 or 3 scalars (either floating point or Quantity)
                    interpreted as cursor parameters (x, xwindow, label) 
                    in THIS ORDER 
                    
                NOTE: for cursor_index and cursor_value functions only, this 
                parameter can also be:
                    a float scalar (signal's domain units are assumed)
                        
                    a scalar python Quantity having units compatible with those
                        of the signal's domain
                
                
        * third parameter (optional) is the channel index (an int, or None).
                
     List of single-cursor functions:
     -------------------------------
        cursor_index -> int, signal sample index at cursor x coordinate
        
        cursor_value -> pyqthon Quantity,  signal value at cursor x coordinate
        
        cursor_average -> Quantity array, the average of signal samples 
            across the cursor's xwindow (one array element per channel), or the 
            cursor_value(...) if cursors' xwindow is zero
        
        cursor_max, cursor_min -> python Quantity array; signal max (min) in the
            cursor's xwindow, or cursor_value if xwindow is 0
                                
        cursor_argmax, cursor_argmin -> numpy array, index of the signal sample
            with the max (min) value within the cursor's window, from the start
            of the signal, or cursor_index if cursor's xwindow is 0.
            
            Unlike cursor_index, these functions return a numpy array due to the
            fact that the maximum of a signal channel need not be at the same
            sample index for all the channels!
                                
        cursor_maxmin -> tuple of Quantity arrays in THIS order: 
                    signal maximum and minimum
                    
        cursor_argmaxmin -> tuple of numpy arrays with the indices of signal
            maximum and minimum (in THIS order)
            
            
    Functions based on two cursors
    ==============================
        * first parameter is a neo.AnalogSignal or datatypes.DataSignal
        
        * second and third parameters are SignalCursor objects, or SignalCursor
            parameter tuples
    
        * third parameter (optional) is the channel index (an int, or None).
        
    List fo functions based on cursor pairs:
    ---------------------------------------
        cursors_distance: -> int, the distance (in signal samples) between 
            cursors
            
        cursors_difference -> python Quantity, the signed difference between
            cursor_average at each of the cursors
            
        cursors_chord_slope -> python Quantity, slope of a straight line through
            the signal values at the cursors; signal value is obtained from
            cursor_average(...)

neoutils:
    new functions to convert between cursors, epoch, intervals:
    
    cursors2epoch: sequence of cursors => neo.Epoch
    cursors2intervals: sequence of cursors => sequence of intervals
    intervals2cursors: sequence of intervals => sequence of cursors or cursor parameters
    intervals2epoch: sequence of intervals => neo.Epoch
    epoch2cursors: neo.Epoch => sequence of cursors
    epoch2intervals: neo.Epoch => sequence of intervals

    removed: 
        interval2cursor (intervals2cursors does the same thing)
        interval2epoch (intervals2epoch does the same thing)
        
    NOTE: cursor refers to a SignalCursor object of vertical type, or a
    parameter triplet (x, xwindow, label) describing a notional vertical 
    cursor.
    
    Converison functions accepting these cursors can also accept
    crosshair SignalCursors (as they to have x and xwindow parameters).
    
    NOTE: interval refers to a tuple (t0, t1) or a triplet (t0, t1, label)
    representing an interval of a signal.
    
    t0 and t1 are numeric scalars, or python Quantity objects (also scalars
    i.e. their size attribute is one)
    
    When present, label must be a non-emty string.

core.mainwindow.MainWindow.loadDiskFile:
    parse the file reader function return annotations with inspect.Signature
    
plugins.ltp.LTPWindow:
    slot_openBaselineRecords: delegates to openDataAcquisitionFiles (new function)
    
    new functions:
        openDataAcquisitionFiles: Opens electrophysiology data acquisition files.
        
    
neoutils:
    created ElectrophysiologyDataParser class -- to be completed
        purpose: encapsulate acquisition parameters and protocols for 
        electrophysiology data
        
        Intended to provide a common denominator for data acquired with various 
        electrophysiology software vendors. 
        
        Planned support: pClamp, CD Signal and Spike, Ephus, generic (i.e., 
        neo.Block, neo.Segment, and objects from neo signal family but without
        acquisition software-specific information).
        
        Will also implement detection/manual configuration of trigger events
        and trigger protocols (a.k.a stimulation/acquisition protocols).
