    generic "smart" GUI for function arguments:
        * use inspect.Signature to dig out parameters for the callable then 
            dynamically egenerate a dialog to prompt user for parameter values
            (populated with defaults where applicable); result (if any) returned
            to the Workspace (with option to bind the return variables to 
                              identifiers)
        * for POD types, tuple, list: enter values directly (number, str)
        * for "compound" objects (including dict) use the workspace
            symbol that is bound to the variable needed as parameter
    
    "smart" "Preferences" gui dialog/wizard for Qt Configurables
        * collect QtConfigurables then inspect getter & setter properties for
            default and new values, respectively
        * build dialog to enter new values → call the setters.
        * POD types, tuple and list should be supported directly (i.e. enter value in dialog UI elements)
        * compound objects: not supported by the QSettings backend anyway!

    re-activate plugin mechanism → factor code in epys, imaging, etc, as plugins.

NOTE 2019-10-06 00:41:18
Stop using vigra.pyqt package, as it depends on VigraQt which as of the time of
writing has build issues with Pyqt5 and python3 and appears unmaintained
Use instead the quickdialog module directly (copied from vigra.pyqt package)

NOTE: 2016-09-29 11:27:07
Update period from August to September 2016:

* Python dependencies are now (2016-09-29 11:32:07) as follows: 
    Python 3.4, 
    PyQt5, 
    sip 4.16.9, 
    jupyter/ipyton/qtconsole (see below)
    pywavelets 0.4.0 (pywt)
    javabridge 1.0.14
    python-bioformats 1.0.8 (make sure this is NOT biopython)
    qimage2ndarray 1.6
    
    numpy & matplotlib & pylab -- these are the distribution ones
    
* Other (C++ and python bindings, see README.rst in this directory)
    boost C++ 1.61 -- built against pytohn 3.4 -> installed in /usr/local; NOT the distribution one
    vigra 1.11 -- built against boost 1.61 (see above) AND python 3.4, Qt5 AND PyQt5
    vigraqt -- built against vigra 1.11 (see above), Qt5 and PyQt5
    
    
    
    
* best install them as "user" using pip3 (e.g., will be installed in ~/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages)

* NOTE: installing qtconsole 4.2.1 (Jupyter QtConsole 4.2.1), IPython 5.0.0 will check
 and install automatically (if enabled, which is the default for pip3) several top-level
 packages:
    IPython (ipython 5.0.0), 
    ipykernel 4.4.1, 
    ipython_genutils 0.1.0, 
    jupyter_client 4.3.0, 
    jupyter_core 4.1.1
    nbformat 4.1.0
    nbconvert 4.2.0
    qtconsole 4.2.1
    
    ... and maybe others too ...
    ? pickleshare, traitlets, prmpt_toolkit, rope, setuptools (easy_install), simplegeneric, entrypoints, pkg_resources
    ?? (these might have been installed by me on the same day) qtpy, qtawsome



Here, the console (subclass of RichIPythonWidget) starts an embedded kernel
then is managed by ScipyenWindow.

NOTE: The ipkernel is embedded in the RichIPythonWidget console -- they are part 
of the same process. Hence the kernel cannot be initiated independently of the console; in fact
it can only be started when the console instance is created (because is this instance that
embeds the new kernel)

* * *

To make this code agnostic with respect to PyQt4 or PySide, install and use python_qt_binding

(1) The IPython console is an EmbedIPython object, connected to an IPython kernel.

EmbedIPython a subclass of RichIPythonWidget and is used to create an 
IPython console, connected to, an IPython kernel.

RichIPythonWidget is in module IPython.qt.console.rich_ipython_widget, and is a subclass
of IPythonWidget in module IPython.qt.console.ipython_widget

IPythonWidget is a subclass of FrontendWidget in module IPython.qt.console.frontend_widget

FrontendWidget is "A Qt frontend for a generic Python kernel." and inherits:

HistoryConsoleWidget from module IPython.qt.console.history_console_widget

and

BaseFrontendMixin from module IPython.qt.base_frontend_mixin: "A mix-in class for implementing Qt frontends."

HistoryConsoleWidget inherits ConsoleWidget from module IPython.qt.console.console_widget

ConsoleWidget is "An abstract base class for console-type widgets"

(2) The kernel itself is managed (and started) by QtInProcessKernelManager

(3) The bidirectional exchange of variables between the MainWindow and the kernel occurs via a Python dictionary
