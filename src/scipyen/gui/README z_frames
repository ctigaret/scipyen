Logic for frame index assignment in a PlanarGraphics primitive
---------------------------------------------------------------
States of a PlanarGraphics:
    a) ubiquitous: z_frame is None
        visible in any frame available in the data
        
    b) frame-avoiding (fa): (int) z_frame < 0
        visible in any frame available in the data EXCEPT the frame with index
         -z_frame -1 (if such frame exists)
         
    c) single-frame (sf): (int) z_frame >= 0
        ONLY visible in the frame with index == z_frame (if such frame exists)
        
Rules:
    
    I. One frame - one state:
        
        In any frame there cannot be more than one state visible
        
    II. Single ubiquitous state:
        
        If a PlanarGraphics has a ubiquitous state, then this is the ONLY state:
        
            self._states_ = [state]
        
    III. Coexistence of frame-avoiding and single-frame states.
    
        A PlanarGraphics primitive object can have only one frame-avoiding state:
            
            self._states_ = [fa_state]
        
        If a PlanarGraphics has a frame-avoiding state, then it can also have
        AT MOST one single-frame state which is visible in the frame with the 
        index avoided by the former, such that the following is True:
            
            sf_state.z_frame == -1 * fa_state.z_frame -1
            
        It follows that:
        
            self._states_ is [fa_state, sf_state]
        

    IV. Coexistence of single-frame states
    
        A PlanarGraphics primitive object can have any number of single-frame
        states PROVIDED they have unique values for z_frames.
        
        If the frame with index state.z_frame is not present in the data, then
        the state is NOT visible anywhere.
        
        
Implementation of rules - changing frame indices (pseudo-code)

Scenario 1. Changing z_frame value for a single state, to a ""new_frame_index""
    
    Should be implemented by a function which takes two parameters (arguments):
        "state":  a DataBag or an int index into self._states_
        "new_frame_index": None or an int;
        
        The state parameter:
            * if a DataBag it must be found in self._states_
            * if an int it must be 0 <= state < len(self._states_)

        
        if new_frame_index is None:
            the state becomes ubiquitous
            all other states are discarded
        
        elif isinstance(new_frame_index , int):
            if new_frame_index < 0:
                the state becomes frame-avoiding 
                all other states are discarded EXCEPT the single-frame state that
                    would be visible in the frame with index 
                    -1 * "new_frame_index" - 1 if such a state exists.
                
            if new_frame_index >= 0:
                the state becomes single-frame
                
                - if there is another single-frame state visible in the frame with
                index "new_frame_index", it is discarded (i.e. replaced by the
                state that underwent the change in z_frame)
                
                - if there is a frame-avoiding state fa_state invisible in the 
                frame with index "new_frame_index", i.e.
                    fa_state.z_frame == -new_frame_index - 1
                    
                    then the fa_state is left in place
                
                - if there is a frame-avoiding state fa_state that is visible
                in the frame with index "new_frame_index", i.e.
                    
                    fa_state.z_frame != -new_frame_index - 1
                
                    then it is COPIED to generate single-frame states visible in
                    all frames where the original fa_state would have been visible
                    EXCEPT the frame with index "new_frame_index"
    

    Function example: PlanarGraphics.setFrameIndex(state, new_frame)

    Function parameters:
    
    * state: a DataBag, an int, or None.
        
        DataBag: a state object
        
            must be found in self._states_ i.e., the call:
        
        >>> index_of(self._states_, state, key = lambda x: x.z_frame)
        
            does not return None, but an int >= 0 instead;
            (this also implies state is a reference to an element of self._states_)
        
        int: the index of the state we wish to modify
            must be >= 0 and < len(self._states_)
            
        None: assume we work on the state for the current frame (whether it is
            visible or Not in the current frame)
    
    * frameindex is either None, or an int:
    
        1. when None, the state with index ndx in self._states_ is made ubiquitous
        
            if state_index is given:
            >>> self._states_[state_index].z_frame = None
            >>> self._states_[:] = [self._states_[state_index]]
        
        2. when an int:
            if frameindex < 0:
                
            2.1 if empty or if it contains at least ONE None element, treat as
                case (1)
            
            2.2 if not empty:
    
    a) need to know the index of the state in self._states_
    if 
    
    1) initial : several single-frame states
        z_frames: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 # sf_states
    
        1.1) current frame = x; 
            there is a frame visible in frame x, and the index of this visible 
                state in the states list is ndx:
                    
                    states[ndx].z_frame == x
        
        1.1.1) intended change: set the state that is visible in the current frame
            to be visible in all BUT the current frame
            
            * this means:
                    1.1.1.1) change states[ndx].z_frame from x to y, where:
                        
                            x = states[ndx].z_frame
                    
                            y = -x - 1
                    
                        >>> states[ndx].z_frame = y
                
                    remove all states where either:
                            
                        z_frame == y or z_frame  == -y-1 == x 
                        
                        (NOTE: since states[ndx] originally had z_frame = x second condition won't be met)
                        
                        >>> states[:] = [s for s in states if s.z_frame == y or s.z_frame == -y-1]
                    
        1.1.2) generalization: intended change: set an sf state to be avoiding some other frame index z
                
                a)  the index of the 
                
                x = state.z_frame
                y = -z-1
