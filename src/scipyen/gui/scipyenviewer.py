class ScipyenViewer(QtWidgets.QMainWindow, WorkspaceGuiMixin):
    """Base type for all Scipyen viewers.
    
    Includes common functionality for all viewer classes defined in Scypien.
    
    Inherits from WorkspaceGuiMixin which provides accesss to the Scipyen's 
    workspace and, indirectly, to the management of Qt and non-Qt settings 
    (through inheritance from ScipyenConfigurable)
    
    Derived classes:
    -----------------
    DataViewer, MatrixViewer, ScipyenFrameViewer, TableEditor, TextViewer, XMLViewer
    
    Developer information:
    -----------------------
    As a minimum, subclasses of ScipyenViewer must:
    
    1) define a :class: attribute named "viewer_for_types", set to a tuple or
        list of python data types supported by the viewer.

        Viewers also support sequences of data (list, tuple); the objects in the 
        sequence must be of one of the types specified here.

        This attribute is mostly for the benefit of Scipyen's mechanism of 
        choosing an appropriate viewer for an object in the workspace, but it 
        can be used by the viewer itself to determine what to do with the "data"
        passed to its constructor.
        
    
    2) define a :class: attribute called "view_action_name" set to a str that 
        gives the name for the menu item invoked to display a variable using this
        viewer. Scipyen will use this attribute to generate a menu item in the
        Workspace context menu. 
        
        NOTE: The Workspace context is invoked by single click of the right mouse
        button on a selected variable name in Scipyen "User variables" tab.
    
    2) implement the following abstract methods:
    
    _set_data_(data:object) -- sets up the actual display of data by the viewer's
        widgets (this may involve populating a custom data model specific
        to the viewer type and/or set).
        
        NOTE: ScipyenViewer holds a reference to the displayed data in the 
        attribute "_data_", but this mechanism can be superceded in the derived
        type.
    
    _configureUI_() -- configures specific GUI widgets and menus
        
         ATTENTION: If the viewer inherits Qt widgets and actions defined in a
        QtDesigner *.ui file (loaded with uic.loadUiType()) then this function
        must call self.setupUi() very early.
    
    If there are viewer type-specific settigns that need to be made persistent
    across sessions then the following abstract mthods also need to be implemented:
    
        saveViewerSettings() -- saves viewer class-specific settings
    
        loadViewerSettings() -- loads viewer class-specific settings
        
    The other methods may be reimplemented in the derived classes.
    
    The python data types that the viewer subclass is specialized for, are
    specified in the class attribute "viewer_for_types". This attribute is a 
    tuple or list of python types. 
    
    The same data type may be handled by more than one type of viewers, but one
    of these is the "preferred" one.
    
    When several viewer types can handle the same data type Scipyen assigns 
    priorities based on the order in which the data types are contained in the 
    "viewer_for_types" attribute.
    
    The viewer type where the data type occurs at index 0 in the viewer_for_types
    (i.e. is the first element) is the viewer with the highest priority, and so 
    on.
    
    Viewer types where a data type has the same index in their "viewer_for_types"
    attribute are prioritized in increasing alphabetical order of the viewer types.
    
    For example, a (2D) numpy.ndarray may be displayed in MatrixViewer, as well 
    as in TableEditor. 
    
    If numpy.ndarray if the first element in TableEditor.viewer_for_types
    but has a higher index in MatrixViewer.viewer_for_types then Scipyen will 
    "prefer" the TableEditor to display the array when the user double clicks the
    left mouse buttom on the array name in the "User variables" tab.
    
    If, however, numpy.ndarray occurs at the same index in the "viewer_for_types"
    attribute of both MatrixViewer and TableEditor, then Scipyen will use
    MatrixViewer.
    
    The other available viewer types can be invoked by menu items generated by
    Scipyen automatically according to the contents of the "viewer_for_types"
    attribute of the viewer classes; the names of these menu items are set by
    the value of the "view_action_name" attribute.
    
    DataViewer has a special place. It has been designed to display tree-like
    data structures (e.g. dict and derived types) but can also display any python 
    object that has a "__dict__" attribute. Therefore, the dict and derived types
    shuld be the first elements in DataViewer.viewer_for_types. In this way, other 
    data types for which there exists a specialized viewer will be displayed, 
    by default, in that specialized viewer, instead of DataViewer.

            viewer should be removed (deleted) from the window management
            attributes of the owner. 
            Default is False.

    This should be inherited by viewers for data that is organized, or can be 
    sliced, in "frames","sweeps" or "segments", and display one frame (sweep or 
    segment) at a time.
    
    ScipyenFrameViewer inherits from ScipyenViewer and supplements it with code
    (attributes and abstract methods) for managing data frames.
    
    The abstract methods defined in ScipyenViewer must still be implemented in
    the derived types
    
    ScipyenFrameViewer also defines the Qt signal frameChanged, which should be
    emitted by the implementation of currentFrame setter method.
    
    Examples:
    
    Use ImageViewer to display a 2D array view (slice) of a 3D array (e.g., vigra.VigraArray);
        the slice view is taken the array axis designated as "frame axis".
    
    Use SignalViewer to display:
        one neo.Segment out of a sequence of neo.Segments, possibly contained in a neo.Block
        
        one neo.BaseSignal (or its derivative) out of a stand-alone collection of signals
        
        one 1D array view (slice) of a 2D array (e.g. numpy ndarray or vigra.VigraArray)
        
    ATTENTION: Synchronizing frame navigation across instances of ScipyenFrameViewer.
    
    1) Subclasses of ScipyenFrameViewer should have at least one of the following
    attributes (references to QWidgets) for frame nagivation:
    â€¢ '_frames_slider_' â†’ QSlider
    â€¢ '_frames_spinner_' â†’ QSpinBox
    â€¢ '_frames_spinBoxSlider_' â†’ SpinBoxSlider
    
    In the implementation of _configureUI_() these widgets should then be 
    aliased to self._frames_slider_, self._frames_spinner_, self._frames_spinBoxSlider_,
    to  allow for synchronization of frame navigation, e.g.:
    
        self._frames_slider_ = self.myQSliderQWidget
    
    2) To enable or disable synchronized frame navigation, use linkToViewers() or
    unlinkViewer() / unlinkFromViewers(), respectively.
    
    Synchronized viewers display the data frame with the same index (provided
    that the frame index is valid for their individually displayed data). 
        
    Navigating across frames in one viewer is propagated to all viewers that
    are synchronized with it.
    
    Derived classes:
    ----------------
    In Scipyen code tree:
        ImageViewer, SignalViewer

    In scipyen_plugins (outside main Scipyehn code tree):
        LSCaTWindow, EventAnalysis, LTPAnalysis, APTrains.
        (NOTE: Some of these still need to be finalised/written)

    ATTENTION: When deriving a viewer window type from ScipyenFrameViewer:

    â€¢ in the __init__ method of the derived type call `super().__init__(...)` in  
        order to create an instance of the superclass ScipyenFrameViewer.
        
        The superclass __init__ method calls two methods which have to be 
        implemented specifically in the derived viewer class:
        
        âˆ˜ `self._configureUI_` 

        âˆ˜ `self._set_data_`
        
        The call order is as follows (â†“ indicates temporal succession,

        The above call sequence mandates that instance variables of the derived
        class be assigned default values BEFORE calling super().__init__()

    â€¢ define (implement) `self._set_data_()` method:
        This is called by self.setData (defined in ScipoyenViewer superclass) 
        and will parse the data to be displayed in order to set up properties 
        of the various GUI widgets in the derived class.
        
        If specific customizations are rewuired by the derived viewer you may
        call super().__init__() with `data` parameter set to None, then call 
        `self._set_data_` manually in the subclass __init__, passing custom 
        parameters to it. This ensures self._set_data_ is called AFTER the call
        to self._configureUI_
        
        NOTE: `self._set_data_` can be called either directly or indirectly by 
        calling `self.setData` method inherited all the way from ScipyenViewer.
        
        The self._set_data_ method MUST:
        âˆ˜ assign the "data" object to self._data_ property (inherited all the
            way from ScipyenViewer)
        
        âˆ˜ assign values to the following instance attributes inherited from 
            ScipyenFrameViewer:
            â–¡ self._data_var_name_
            â–¡ self._data_frames_
            â–¡ self._frameIndex_
            â–¡ self._number_of_frames_
        
        âˆ˜ assign values to instance attributes of the derived class, containing
            properties of GUI widgets of the derived class.
        
        âˆ˜ set the properties of the GUI widgets according to the instance 
            attributes listed above
        
    â€¢ implement widgets for frame navigation; you need:
        
        âˆ˜ EITHER one QSpinBox instance named '_frames_spinner_' AND 
                 one QSlider  instance named '_frames_slider_'
        
        âˆ˜ OR an instance of a SpinBoxSlider, named '_frames_spinBoxSlider_'
        
        These names are expected to be there among the instance attributes of 
        the class derived from ScipyenFrameViewer.
        
    â€¢ If the derived class managed several instances of ScipyenFrameViewer (e.g.
        several image and/or signal viewer instances that display one 'frame' at a
        time from the same number of 'frames') then, in __init__ make sure you
        call self.linkToViewers(...)

    â€¢ define (implement) `self._configureUI_()`, but do NOT call it directly:
        âˆ˜ this method is called by the ScipyenFrameViewer __init__ (see above).

        âˆ˜ the method instantiates the GUI widgets and connects their signals to 
            appropriate slots (Qt framework)
        
            WARNING: Make sure these slots are defined (implemented) in the 
                derived class, unless they are already inherited (and NOT defined
                as abstract methods) from the ScipyenFrameViewer or ScipyenViewer
                superclasses.

        âˆ˜ ATTENTION: in classes that use UI forms generated with Qt 5 Designer, 
            this method MUST call `self.setupUi(self)` first thing, in order to
            instantiate all the widgets declared in the UI form.
        
        âˆ˜ CAUTION: the widgets properties may require certain class or instance
            attributes having default values  - make sure these conditions are 
            met.
