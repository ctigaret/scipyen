Specification of color maps for matplotlib
------------------------------------------

Matplotlib "colors" module supports ListedColormap and LinearSegmentedColormap.

ListedColormap.colors is a list of lists of R,G,B values in the closed interval [0,1]

LinearSegmentedColormap._segmentdata is a dict with keys "red", "green", "blue"
each mapped to a list of triplets (x, y0, y1).

Both can be written to/read from ASCII files (either comma- or tab-separated 
values) with extention ".txt".

These files can be saved either in this directory (hence distributed
with Scipyen), in Scipyen's configuration directory (on Unix this is 
~/.config/Scipyen) or in the current working directory - see 
scipyen/gui/scipyen_colormaps.py module for details.

The ASCII file contents follow one of two alternative templates:
    
    1) for ListedColormap:        
        Three columns with the first row (header) being "r", "g", "b"
        and all other rows containing floating point values in the closed 
        interval [0,1].
        
        For example:
            
        r,g,b
        0.267004,0.004874,0.329415
        0.26851,0.009605,0.335427
        0.269944,0.014625,0.341379
        0.271305,0.019942,0.347269
        0.272594,0.025563,0.353093
        0.273809,0.031497,0.358853
        0.274952,0.037752,0.364543
        0.276022,0.044167,0.370164
        0.277018,0.050344,0.375715
        0.277941,0.056324,0.381191
        0.278791,0.062145,0.386592
        0.279566,0.067836,0.391917
        0.280267,0.073417,0.397163
        0.280894,0.078907,0.402329
        0.281446,0.08432,0.407414
        0.281924,0.089666,0.412415
        0.282327,0.094955,0.417331
        0.282656,0.100196,0.42216
        0.28291,0.105393,0.426902
        0.283091,0.110553,0.431554
        ...
        
    2) for LinearSegmentedColormap:
        Four columns with the first row (header) being "c", "x", "y1", "y2"
        
        For the rest of the rows, the first column contains one of "r", "g", "b"
        characters, whereas the other three columns contain floating point values
        in the closed interval [0,1]
        
        For example:
            
        c,x,y0,y1
        r,0.0,0.0,0.0
        r,0.5,0.0,0.0
        r,0.75,1.0,1.0
        r,1.0,1.0,1.0
        g,0.0,0.0,0.0
        g,0.5,1.0,1.0
        g,1.0,1.0,1.0
        b,0.0,0.0,0.0
        b,0.25,0.66,0.66
        b,0.5,0.0,0.0
        b,0.75,0.0,1.0
        b,1.0,1.0,1.0
        
        Note that the values in the "x" column spanning the SAME character in the 
        first column (i.e., either "r", "g", or "b") MUST be monotonically 
        increasing and within the cloed intervl [0,1] as well.
        
        ATTENTION: This criterion is not yet checked when reading these files.
