The resources for GUI classes (including icons from the breeze and breeze-dark 
themes) are now generated outside the git tree, to avoid clobbering the git 
repository. The compilation requires the python module compile_resources.py in 
this out-of-git tree (currently, in ~/src/for scipyen/resources 23i30b
on the machine used for Scipyen development).

When creating/editing new ui files using the qt5 designer (currently, only
supported on Linux/KDE) make use of the breeze icon theme installed on the 
developing machine. NOTE: you may want to check that a particular icon IS
present in the out-of-git tree.

Any additional images NOT present in the icon themes mentioned above SHOULD be 
placed in resource/images (in the out-of-git tree)

TODO: include the icons themes in the scipyenv (provide this for the installation
script) and somehow install qt5 designer there, too - WARNING: Not sure one can
do this on non-Linux platforms without installing the entire Qt5 distribution, 
which, frankly, I would rather NOT do...

All the resource objects required are now distributed in binary form in 
python modules (*_rc.py) imported via resources_rc.py in this directory. This
has implications for Windows (and possibly, MacOS) but since Scipyen development
only takes place on a Linux platform (for the forseeable future), the non-Linux
platforms are most likely to benefit only from the binary Scipyen distros created
with pyinstaller.

Therefore, when running Scipyen from the git tree:
    • on a Linux platform, we rely on the breeze and breeze-dark themes installed
        system-wide (or any other icon theme, that follows the freedesktop icon
                     theme specification)
        
    • on any other plaform, we rely on the compiled (binary) resources in the 
        *_rc.py modules, which ARE part of the git repository tree (hence updated
        upon git pull)
        
When running Scipyen from a binary tree (created with pyinstaller) this problem
should be moot, as the *_rc.py files is all we need and ARE packaged with the 
binary distribution.
