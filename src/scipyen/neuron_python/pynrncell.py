        """Add a section to this cell.
        
        The section is created using stylized geometry (L, nseg, diam) with
        'diam' being set the same across all 'nseg' discretization segments (or 
        compartments), then added as an instance attribute to the cell.
        
        Once created in this way, the section's geometry and discretization can
        be further refined by calling self.refineGeom(sec), ideally AFTER setting
        new values for the section's Ra and cm attributes (by default, the newly
        created section has the NEURON's default values for Ra: 35.4 and )
        
        A cell must have at least one section - usually called "soma" but one is
        free to use any name as long as it is unique.
        
        This method creates and returns a nrn.Section object (a "section"). The
        section is also assigned to an attribute of this PyNRNCell instance, 
        that is named after the section (hence section names must be unique).
        
        The newly created section can be connected to another existing section
        in this cell, which is identified by its name. By default, the 
        the 0 end of the new section is connected to the 1 end of the parent 
        section, but this can also be configured.
        
        The created section has a stylized geometry specified by the 'section'
        variables 'L' and 'nseg', and by the range variable 'diam' (see
        https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/8.0.0/python/modelspec/programmatic/topology/geometry.html#geometry-geometry)
        
        The parameters represent 'section', 'range', or discretization variables 
        (see Chapter 5 in Hines & Carnevale The NEURON Book). 
        
        Briefly, 'section' variables have constant value for the entire section, 
        regardless of how many segments (or compartments) the section has. 
        
        In contrast, 'range' variables are continuous functions of position 
        throughout the section. The position is the normalized distance along 
        the centroid of the section, a.k.a the "range" or "arc length", and 
        varies linearly from 0 at one end to 1 at the other end.

        With the exception of 'Ra' and 'cm' which specify biophysical properties
        all other parameters relate to the geometry of the section, and its
        discretization.
        
        The section geometry can be specified in a stylized manner (as a chain 
        of cylindrical segments or compartments) based on the 'L', 'diam' and 
        'nseg' parameters, or via the '3D method' as a sequence of at least two 
        (x,y,z,diam) tuples.
        
        Positional-only parameters:
        ===========================
        name:str. The name of the section; it must be a valid Python identifier 
            and not present in this cell's sections.
            
        Named parameters:
        =================
        L: scalar (Real). Optional, default is 1. 
            Section length (in um); this is a section variable.
        
        nseg: int >= 1, ideally an odd value; optional, default is None. 
            The discretization parameter i.e., the number of 'segments' (or 
            'compartments') in the section; this is a section variable.
            
            To use PyNRNCell default value (51) pass PyNRNCell.default_nseg 
            explicitly, here.
            
        diam: one of:
            1) Real scalar > 0 : the diameter of the section (in µm); optional,
            the default is NEURON's default (500)
            
            In this case the section will have the same diameter along all its
            segments (considered as a right cylinder).
            
            2) a sequence (tuple, list) of two strictly positive Real scalars
            (i.e, > 0). The diameters of the section's segments at their 'x' 
            coordinate will be linearly interpolated between these two values.
            
            3) a nested sequence of pairs of Real scalars > 0; the number of 
            pairs must be equal to that of the section's 'nseg' variable. The 
            diameter of each segment will be interpolated between the values in 
            the pair, in the order given here.
            
            In this case the 'nseg' parameter MUST be given explicitly.
            
            NOTE: The diameters of the section's segments can be re-adjusted by
            interpolation once the section's nseg has been refined using the 
            d_lambda rule.
            
            In cases (2) and (3) the interpolation occurs on the interval [0., 1.]
            unless specified via the 'diam_interp' parameter, below.
            
        diam_interp: sequence or nested sequence that contains real scalars (at
            the deepest nesting level) and with shape that is identical to that 
            of 'diam' (cases 2 and 3, see above). The scalars must take values
            in the closed interval [0., 1.]
            
        Ra  : Real scalar >= 0. The cytoplasmic (axial) resistivity (Ohm·cm); 
            optional, default is 35.4 Ohm·cm; section variable.
            
        cm: Real scalar, or a sequence with structure similar to that of 'diam'
            (see above). Optional the default is None.
            
            The specific membrane capacitance (µF/cm²).
            
            When None, the section gets NEURON's default value of 1
            
            When a float scalar, it represents the membrane capacitance for the
            entire section.
            
            NOTE: As for diam, cm can be finely set by interpolation on each of
            the section's segments AFTER the section's 'nseg' value has been set
            here.
            
            NOTE: This is a range variable
            
        cm_interp: as diam_interp, above; used for interpolating the 'cm' for
            each segment in the section.
            
        * Discretization parameters:
        
        freq: float scalar (optional, default is None). The frequency (in Hz) 
            at which the section's AC length constant (λf) is calculated using 
            the 'lambda_f' function, defined in this module.
            
            This is used together with 'd_lambda' below, to calculate an 
            'optimal' discretization value (the section 'nseg' variable), only
            when 'nseg' parameter is not specified as a positive int.
            
            Here, 'optimal' means that the section segments are NOT longer than
            d_lambda × λf at the value of freq.
            
            When not specified (i.e. 'freq' is None), the NEURON's recommended 
            value of 100 Hz will be used.
            
            CAUTION: This calculation relies on the section's 'Ra' and 'cm' 
            properties. So, when neither Ra nor cm are specified, the NEURON's
            default values Ra = 35.4 and cm = 1 will be used. In particular,
            when 'cm' is specified as a float scalar, it will be used to
            calculate 'nseg'. This might appear to create a chicken-egg problem,
            as the 'cm' is a range variable (hence it MAY vary with the number
            of section compartments)
            
            To change a section's nseg according to the d_lambda rule AFTER the 
            section was created, use geomNseg(...) method.
            
        d_lambda: float scalar with values in [0., 1.]. The fraction of the AC
            length constant at 'freq' frequency (λf); (optional, default is None).
            
            This is used together with 'freq' (see above) to calculate an
            'optimal' discretization value (the section 'nseg' variable) , only 
            when 'nseg' is not specified as a positive int.
            
            When not specified (i.e. when d_lambda is None) the NEURON's 
            recommended value of 0.1 will be used.
            
        * Connectivity parameters:
                    
        parent: nrn.Section; optional (default is None)
            When present, the new section will be connected to 'parent'.
            Parent must be a section that already exists in the cell and must be
            a distinct object from the newly created section.
        
        parent_pos: float, between 0 and 1 (optional default is None).
            When specified, this indicates the parent's segment where the new 
            section will be connected.
            
            When None (default) the new section will be connected as the end (1)
            of the parent.
            
        orientation: float, between 0 and 1 (optional, default is 0)
            When specified, this indicates which segment of section is connected
            to the parent.
            
            When None (the default) the section's segment 0 will be connected.
            
        See also the documentation for the nrn.Section.connect(...) method.
        
        * * * 
            

        NOTE: This method calls h.Section(...) to create a HOC section.
        
        Sections created directly in h will optionally belong to a cell, if a 
        'cell' parameter was passsed to the constructor in h.
        
        In either case, once the section has been constructed, HOC does not allow
        setting or changing the cell to which the section belongs.
        
        Therefore, from the HOC interpreter's point of view, sections CANNOT BE 
        "RELOCATED" from a  cell to another, and CANNOT be "added" to a cell 
        AFTER they have been constructed.
        
        Currently, no mechanism is implemented to prevent forcefully setting a 
        random section as an attribute of the cell object. However, doing so will
        mess up the semantics of the model:
        
        * if a section belonging to a cell was "added" to another cell, HOC will
        still interpret the section as being as part of the original cell, which
        may lead to contrived models where a section of a cell is connected to 
        sections of another cell.
        
        * if a section with no cell (section.cell() is None -> True) was "added"
        to another cell, HOC would still interpret it as a section without a cell.
        
        NOTE: 2021-01-23 00:52:17
        In the stylized specification, the shape model used for a section is a 
        sequence of right circular cylinders of length, L/nseg, with diameter 
        given by the diam range variable at the center of each segment. 
        
        The area of a segment is:
        
                PI * diam * L / nseg (micron2) 
        
        and the half-segment axial resistance is:
        
                .01 * sec.Ra * (L / 2 / sec.nseg) / (PI * (seg.diam / 2)^2). 
                
        The .01 factor is necessary to convert ohm-cm micron/micron2 to MegOhms. 
        
        Ends of cylinders are not counted in the area and, in fact, the areas are
        very close to those of truncated cones as long as the diameter does not 
        change too much.
