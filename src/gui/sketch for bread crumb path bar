mainWindow.fileSyetemModel.rootPath() -> is the path to the current folder

realrootpath = os.path.realpath(mainWindow.fileSystemModel.rootPath()) -> is the real path to the current folder

alternatively (,aybe less confusing to the user) just use the unresolved path:
    
rootpath = mainWindow.fileSystemModel.rootPath()

    this needs to be broken down to a bread crumb:
        
        the easiest way is to 
        
        from pathlib import Path
        
        path = Path(realrootpath)
        
        then 
        
        parts = path.parts -> a list of strings
